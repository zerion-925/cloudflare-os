# Plan: GitLab gatekeeper — a GitHub-gatekeeper mirror for gitlab.com and self-hosted instances

## Goal

Ship `packages/gatekeeper-gitlab`, a gatekeeper for GitLab that is functionally equivalent to
`packages/gatekeeper-github` and implemented as a **mirror** of it: the same three resource
granularities (project / issue / merge request), the same action queue with provisional ids and
read-time simulation, the same **worktree integration** through the workspace `GitCache` (commit
ids advertised, `gitPull()` over smart-HTTP, `push()` as a queued action declaring
`pushedCommits`, simulated reads over queued pushes), the same strategy-B observer verification,
and the same sign-in support (`providesAuth`). An agent that has learned to work a GitHub
repository through a worktree should be able to do the same against a GitLab project with only
vocabulary changes.

Two things the GitHub gatekeeper never needed, and which this one exists to add:

- **Instance configuration.** GitLab is commonly self-hosted. The gatekeeper is configured by
  `GITLAB_URL` (what the user's browser visits; default `https://gitlab.com`), an optional
  `GITLAB_API_URL` (what the Worker talks to, when that differs), and an optional Cloudflare
  Access **service token** pair attached to every Worker→GitLab request — because a self-hosted
  GitLab behind Cloudflare Access is a real deployment shape, including our own.
- **Rotating credentials.** GitLab access tokens expire after two hours and refresh tokens are
  single-use. GitHub's `UserAccount` stores one non-expiring token; this one refreshes under a
  lock and persists the rotated refresh token atomically.

Supporting cast:

- **Git layer moved into `@gadgets/gatekeeper-kit`.** `git-transport.ts`, `git-diff.ts`, and the
  pure git-object half of `git-commits.ts` have no platform imports and take fetch callbacks, not
  a `GitHubApi`; they become kit leaf modules (`./git-transport`, `./git-objects`, `./git-diff`)
  that both gatekeepers import. No second copy of the pkt-line composer.
- **The internal deployment replaces its incubating GitLab stub with this package.** That is a
  separate PR in the internal repo (its own companion plan there); this document notes only what
  the public package must expose for that to be a configuration change.

Two PRs total: one here (kit extraction + the gatekeeper), one in the internal repo (submodule
bump, stub removal, config, secrets). See [Commit sequence](#commit-sequence).

## Locked decisions

- **Mirror, don't redesign.** Same file layout (`gitlab.ts`, `gitlab-api.ts`, `types.d.ts` +
  `types.txt` symlink, `gitlab-configurators.ts`, `configurator/*`, `observability.ts`,
  `storage-schema.md`), same class structure (`GatekeeperVendor`, `UserAccount`,
  `GatekeeperUserImpl`, `GitLabVerifier`, `GitLabGatekeeperImpl`, `GitLabProjectSessionImpl`,
  `GitLabIssueImpl`, `GitLabMergeRequestImpl`), same storage-key scheme (`counter:*`, `action:*`,
  `retiredAction:*`, `provisional:*`, `diffAlias:*`, `cache:*` with a generation counter; GitHub's
  incremental discussion sync state has no counterpart, as a thread is read whole), same cursor
  classes, same test layout (node suite + workerd suite with a `TestHooks` DO). Diverge
  only where GitLab's API forces it, and record every divergence in §5's table. Rationale:
  reviewers already know the GitHub shape, a fix found in one port applies to the other, and
  "how does GitHub do this" is always an answerable question during implementation.
- **GitLab-native vocabulary in the agent-facing API.** `GitLabProject`, `GitLabIssue`,
  `GitLabMergeRequest`; `createMergeRequest`/`listMergeRequests`/`searchMergeRequests`;
  `sourceBranch`/`targetBranch` (not `head`/`base`); `iid`-derived string ids; states `opened` /
  `closed` (issues) and `opened` / `closed` / `merged` / `locked` (MRs). Agents meet GitLab through
  its URLs and UI, which use these words; translating them to GitHub's would help nobody.
  Structural names that are not GitLab-specific (`Cursor`, `*PageOptions`, `*DiffFile`, `*Hunk`,
  `*Line`, `*Actor`) keep the GitHub shapes with a `GitLab` prefix.
- **Three granularities: project, issue, merge request.** Group-scoped bindings ("everything
  under `some-group/`") — the one thing the internal stub offered that GitHub doesn't — are
  **deferred**: they need strategy-C observers and a project-discovery surface on the session,
  neither of which the mirror has. Deliberately a follow-up, not a silent omission.
- **Instance URL is deployment configuration, not a wizard input.** `GITLAB_URL` and
  `GITLAB_API_URL` are plain `vars` (defaults: `https://gitlab.com`, and `GITLAB_URL`). They are
  *not* `deploy-inputs.json` entries: `manifest-lib.ts` emits bindings only for `secret` inputs,
  and the deploy wizard blocks Install on unfilled inputs, so a `GITLAB_URL` input would force
  every gitlab.com deployer to type it for nothing. Self-hosters set the var after deploy. The
  wizard inputs are the default `CLIENT_ID`/`CLIENT_SECRET` (with `redirectUriTemplate` and
  GitLab-specific `setupSteps`), so the package is deliberately **not** in
  `NO_DEFAULT_CRED_INPUTS`.
- **Every browser-facing URL uses `GITLAB_URL`; every Worker-side request uses `GITLAB_API_URL`.**
  Browser-facing: the OAuth `authorize` redirect (the user's own browser session must reach it),
  `SupportedResource.urlPattern`s (built from env in `getSupportedResources()`, so they can't be
  module constants as GitHub's are), `web_url`-style links in results, `VendorDescription.url`.
  Worker-side: REST, `oauth/token`, `oauth/revoke`, and both git smart-HTTP endpoints. The split exists because an Access-protected instance may expose a service-token
  hostname distinct from the one users log into.
- **Optional upstream Access service token: `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` / `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET`.**
  When both are set, every Worker→GitLab request (REST, OAuth token endpoints, git) carries
  `CF-Access-Client-Id` / `CF-Access-Client-Secret`. When either is unset, nothing is added. Named
  for what they are — Cloudflare Access credentials — because "self-hosted GitLab behind Access"
  is a configuration any Cloudflare customer might run, not an internal peculiarity. They are
  secrets but not wizard inputs (same reasoning as the URL vars: most deployers don't need them).
- **No inbound Access-JWT verification at the HTTP entrypoint.** The internal repo's own
  gatekeepers verify `cf-access-jwt-assertion` on every request; its deployed *public*
  gatekeepers (github, google, slack, zoominfo) do not, and this one follows them. The route is
  gated by the zone's Access policy where one exists, the connect URL is a bearer capability with
  a DO-stored nonce, and the callback is verified by nonce and single-use ticket — the same
  posture as GitHub. Adding the check would pull `jose` into the package to defend a surface the
  other public gatekeepers leave to Access.
- **OAuth: `api write_repository` for connections, `read_user` for sign-in; S256 PKCE; identity
  from `GET /user`.** Two documentation facts shaped this, both overturning the first draft:
  - The docs grant Git-over-HTTPS to OAuth tokens **only** for `read_repository`/`write_repository`
    ("A token with scope `read_repository` or `write_repository` can access Git over HTTPS"); the
    "`api` also covers Git" clause is stated for personal access tokens alone. `api` probably works
    in practice, but `write_repository` is documented and costs nothing, so a connection requests
    both — REST through `api`, fetch/push through `write_repository`.
  - OIDC `userinfo` returns `email`/`email_verified` "only if the application has access to the
    `email` scope **and the user's public email address**" — and most users have no public email.
    So the sign-in identity is `GET /user` → `email` when `confirmed_at` is non-null (GitLab only
    makes an address primary once confirmed, so this is the provider-verified pair, the analogue
    of GitHub's primary+verified). No OIDC scopes are requested at all.
  GitLab has no repository-granular scopes (nor does GitHub — `repo` is everything). PKCE is
  cheap, documented as "recommended for both client and server apps", and
  `gatekeeper-cloudflare/src/oauth.ts` is the in-repo reference; we send `client_secret` *and*
  `code_verifier` (the docs neither require nor forbid the combination). The refresh request
  carries no `redirect_uri`: RFC 6749 §6 defines none, and Doorkeeper, the provider underneath,
  ignores the one GitLab's documented example sends. Auth-only grants are transient
  (2-minute self-destruct alarm), exactly as GitHub's. The `read_user` scope is described as
  exposing the "public email", which reads as though `/user` would omit the private primary
  address; GitLab's source says otherwise: `read_user` admits `GET /user` (`lib/api/users.rb`),
  which presents the token's own user as `Entities::UserPublic`, and that entity exposes `email`
  and `confirmed_at` whatever the public-email setting. That is read from the source, not seen
  live (an EE override of the entity was not checked), so the first live checkpoint confirms it;
  if it fails, the transient sign-in grant requests `read_api` instead (still read-only, still
  discarded within two minutes).
- **The grant lives in the kit's `CredentialCoordinator`, as GitHub's has since #661.**
  `UserAccount.getAccessToken()` is the coordinator's `snapshot`: the stored token while it is
  outside the kit's expiry safety window, otherwise one refresh, redeeming the single-use refresh
  token once however many callers are waiting and **storing the rotated pair before serving
  either**. A refresh GitLab answers `invalid_grant` in a 4xx other than 429 (the kit's
  `isInvalidGrant` rule) is the grant's death: the coordinator records it with the grant, so a
  restarted object does not send the dead refresh token again, and announces it once through the
  kit's `credential-expiry` latch (`notifyCredentialsExpiredOnce`, which latches only after the
  Workshop acknowledges, so a callback that fails transiently is retried by the next refusal).
  Every other refresh failure — a network error, a 429 or 5xx whatever its body, an Access 3xx —
  is transient: that request fails, and the next asks GitLab again. No cooldown replays the
  failure, since the coordinator already redeems once for all the callers waiting on one refresh.
  `discardMint` revokes a mint only when a disconnect overtook it: the
  disconnect revoked the pair it found, which the refresh had already rotated out, and nothing
  survives for the revocation to harm. A mint a reconnect overtook is dropped unrevoked, since
  GitLab does not document that revoking one refresh token leaves the rest of the authorization
  standing (RFC 7009 lets it revoke the lot) and the reconnect's connection must survive.
  The stub-era keys (`accessToken`, `accessTokenExpiresAt`, `refreshToken`, `scopes`) migrate into
  the coordinator's `credentials` record on first read; a stub grant has no `scopes`, reads as
  none, and so `ensureResources` offers the reconnect that widens it while its token keeps serving.
  A `401` is a credential rejection only from `GET /user` (the one request that asserts nothing
  but authentication) and the git endpoints (which authenticate nothing but the bearer). Every
  other endpoint's `401` is that operation's own answer: GitLab documents `PUT …/merge` answering
  401 for "this user does not have permission to accept this merge request", and the approvals
  endpoint requires an eligible approver, so a Reporter trying to merge neither retires their
  connection nor spends a refresh rotation. A credential rejection goes, by the one path —
  `withAccountApi` in `gitlab-env.ts`, shared by the entrypoints and the DO — to
  `reportTokenRejected(presentedToken)`, which the coordinator adjudicates against the token the
  request actually sent. GitLab invalidates an access token when it issues the successor, so a
  token the account no longer holds failed stale: `superseded`, and a `replayable` read runs once
  more with the new token while any other call fails as retryable. A refusal of the token still
  held is refreshed past rather than taken for death (it is also what a request sees while that
  token's refresh is in flight); only an `invalid_grant` on that refresh makes it `expired`.
- **Facts derived from a connection are fenced to it.** The coordinator's
  `connectionGeneration()` moves on every connect, reconnect and disconnect, not on a refresh.
  The observer probe's user id is read from `/user` once per generation and stored against it
  (`user: { id, generation }`), a read that finished under a newer generation is neither stored
  nor returned, and the probe discards a membership row when the generation moved between
  reading the id and reading the row — a reconnect as a different GitLab user landing in that
  window would otherwise pair one user's Reporter membership with another's token and admit the
  wrong person. A connect attempt records the generation it began under (`startedUnder`), and
  both an initial connect and `commitReconnect` write through `connect(grant, { ifGeneration })`:
  a disconnect, or a reconnect that overtook a slower one, wins, and the losing flow's tokens are
  revoked rather than committed over the newer grant.
- **An expired membership admits nobody.** GitLab documents that from a member row's `expires_at`
  onward the user can no longer access the project, but the row is swept by a daily worker, so
  `members/all` can still list it with the date passed. The probe reads the date (a day, taken as
  its UTC midnight) and denies on or after it; a date that does not parse denies too. The row
  `members/all` answers is the direct membership whenever there is one (one row per user,
  `MembersFinder#distinct_on`), so an expired or `awaiting` direct row denies a user whose
  inherited membership is current until the sweep removes it. That fails closed, and with one row
  there is nothing to choose between.
- **Instance URLs are `https` origins.** Every request to `GITLAB_API_URL` carries a user's token
  and the OAuth exchanges carry the client secret and a refresh token; `GITLAB_URL` hosts the
  authorization page users are sent to. Both are validated at use — `https`, or `http` on
  loopback (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `[::1]`) for a GitLab run on the developer's machine — with
  the variable, never its value, in the message; embedded credentials are refused. So is a
  *path*: every URL this package builds (`/api/v4/…`, `/oauth/…`, `/<project>.git/…`) and every
  web URL it parses or emits starts at the root, so a GitLab under a relative URL root is not
  supported, and refusing the path is the honest answer — dropping it would send tokens to
  whatever answers at the root of that host, keeping it would be ignored by every builder.
- **Reconnect on the existing internal connections is accepted.** The internal stub's DO
  classes are `UserAccount` and `GitLabGatekeeperImpl` under migration tag `v0`; this package
  uses the same class names and tag, so the worker upgrades in place with no wrangler migration.
  Existing `UserAccount` rows hold `read_api`-scoped tokens (insufficient for writes and push) and
  existing gatekeeper bindings carry `{scopePath}` props rather than `{projectPath, resourceKind}`.
  Neither is worth migrating: the stub was labelled incubating. Instead the new code **works with
  what the grant allows and offers the remedy where the Workshop asks for it**. `UserAccount`
  reads a stored grant with **no `scopes` key** as an empty scope set (the new code always
  records the scopes it *requested* at grant time; the stub never wrote that key — and the
  documented token response carries no `scope` field, so requested-scopes is the only reliable
  record anyway), so `describe()` and the observer probe — reads a `read_api` token can serve —
  keep working. `GatekeeperUserImpl.ensureResources()` returns the `reconnect()` URL when the
  recorded scopes lack `api` or `write_repository`; that is the interface's own "expand the
  grant" hook, and the Workshop opens the URL in the connect pop-up before binding a resource. A
  `read_api` token that reaches a binding anyway fails closed at GitLab (403 on writes, 401 on
  push). `GitLabGatekeeperImpl` treats missing `resourceKind` in `ctx.props` as a stale binding
  and says so — so stale state tells the user what to do rather than 403ing mysteriously.
- **Worktree support is the same contract as GitHub's, verbatim.** Every session read that
  returns commit ids advertises them (`GitCache.advertiseCommit()`, per page for cursors via the
  advertising wrapper); results served from the git cache rather than from GitLab are never
  advertised; `gitPull()` is smart-HTTP protocol v2 against `GITLAB_API_URL` with no `have`s and
  at most one `filter`; `push()` binds `{branch, expectedOldSha, newSha, force}` at queue time
  against the simulated branch head, declares `pushedCommits`, checks fast-forward via
  `GitCache.isAncestor()` before `submitAction()`, applies via `buildPack()` into a receive-pack
  request whose old-sha CAS is the queue-time expectation, and reverts by ref rollback; simulated
  reads of pending pushes come from `GitCache.get()`. The only GitLab-specific bytes are the URL
  (`{GITLAB_API_URL}/{path_with_namespace}.git/git-{upload,receive}-pack`) and the Basic-auth
  username (`oauth2`, where GitHub uses `x-access-token`). plans/worktrees.md §3 remains the
  design record for all of this; nothing there is re-decided here.
- **Kit extraction lands first, in the same PR, behavior-neutral but for two failure-path
  fixes.** `git-transport.ts` moves verbatim (its comments stop saying "GitHub" where the
  protocol is generic, and the `filterSpecForHints` limits are documented as "verified against
  GitHub; conservative for others"). `git-diff.ts` moves with vendor-neutral type names
  (`GitDiffFile`, `GitDiffHunk`, `GitDiffLine`); `gatekeeper-github/src/types.d.ts` is untouched,
  its `GitHubPullRequestDiff*` types being structurally identical and the agent-facing text
  having to stay self-contained. `git-commits.ts` splits: `isCommitOid`, `parseGitCommitPayload`,
  `parseGitIdentity`, `commitDetailsFromGitObject` (taking a `commitUrl(oid)` callback instead of
  a repo URL), `CommitAdvertiser` and `advertiseCommits` move to `./git-objects`; the four
  `normalize*Response` REST adapters and `actorFromUser` stay in github. Per-page commit
  advertising becomes a hook rather than a cursor class: `advertisePages(advertiser, commitIds,
  {withhold})` in `./git-objects`, run by the kit's generic `PageHookCursor` (`./cursors`), which
  serializes the hook and holds a page whose hook threw so that a retry re-offers it — the
  `CommitAdvertisingCursor` it replaces was not an `RpcTarget`, so every gatekeeper would have
  wrapped it for RPC itself. The two fixes: an id is recorded as advertised only once its
  advertisement resolves (one failed advertisement used to suppress the id for the rest of the
  walk and lose its page), and `parseGitIdentity`'s polynomial-time pattern (§1). Existing node
  tests move with their subjects. Kit gains the `diff` dependency. The github package's diff is
  deletions, import rewrites and the advertising hook — reviewable on its own in the first two
  commits.
- **Reviews are draft notes; all three GitHub decisions are supported.** GitLab has no "review"
  object in REST, but the Draft Notes API — what its own UI's "Submit review" uses — composes
  into one: one draft note per diff comment (`POST …/draft_notes` with `position`), then
  publication. Which publication depends on the decision, because `POST
  …/draft_notes/bulk_publish` is the only call that records a reviewer state, and it publishes
  **every** draft the token's user has on the merge request, a human's parked drafts included
  (see the watch-for). `decision: "requestChanges"` needs that state, so it bulk-publishes with
  `reviewer_state: requested_changes` (documented: "sets the review state after publishing. Does
  not record a formal approval"; honoured from 19.2, and an older instance refuses the review at
  queue time rather than post it as a plain comment), and it refuses while the user has drafts of
  their own there. `decision: "comment"` and `"approve"` have no state to record (`approve`'s
  approval sets its own), so they publish their drafts one at a time and never touch the user's.
  That costs the grouped review: each comment arrives as its own note, probably with its own
  notification, and a comment review does not mark the reviewer as having reviewed. The summary
  is a plain note in every case, posted last. `decision: "approve"` calls `POST …/approve` with
  `sha: revision.headSha` before anything is posted, which the docs guarantee 409s on a stale
  head — so an approval never lands on a head the agent didn't review, and a refused approval
  publishes nothing. That CAS runs only on the attempt that approves, though, and every review's
  comments are positioned in the reviewed diff whatever its decision, so `#publishReview` first
  reads the live merge request on *every* attempt and fails clean if its head is no longer
  `revision.headSha` — a retry resumed after a push would otherwise skip past a recorded
  approval and publish comments into a diff that no longer exists. So
  `GitLabReviewDecision = "comment" | "approve" | "requestChanges"`, the same enum as GitHub. One
  documented caveat travels into the JSDoc: `requested_changes` *blocks merging* only on
  Premium/Ultimate (17.2+; on Free it is a visible reviewer state, nothing more).
- **Merge options are GitLab's.** GitHub's `method: merge|squash|rebase` is replaced by
  `squash?: boolean` and `removeSourceBranch?: boolean` (plus `commitMessage?`,
  `squashCommitMessage?`, `expectedHeadSha?` → `sha`). Merge *method* is a project setting in
  GitLab, not a per-merge choice; exposing one would be a lie the API can't keep.
- **`merge()` binds the head it was asked to merge.** One deliberate divergence from GitHub,
  whose merge sends `sha` only when the agent supplies `expectedHeadSha`: an approver approves
  "merge !N" at one moment and the merge applies at another, against whatever head exists then,
  so commits pushed in between (a collaborator's, or the agent's own through another approved
  push) would merge unreviewed. `push()` already binds `expectedOldSha` at queue time for exactly
  this class of race. So `prepareMergeMergeRequest` reads the merge request's current source head
  (a read that only prepares the action, so it records no observation — upstream #593), binds
  it as `sha` unless the agent supplied its own, and names it in the approval description; GitLab
  answers 409 if the head has moved, the agent re-reads, and the human approves merging the new
  state — the correct outcome. For a provisional merge request the bound head is the simulated
  one (the queued push's commit), which is the head it will have once created. GitHub's merge
  should do the same; see Punted.
- **`close()` takes no reason.** GitLab issues have no `state_reason`; the parameter would be
  ignored. Dropped rather than accepted-and-discarded.
- **Discussion is user-authored notes; approvals are MR metadata.** `readDiscussion()` returns
  non-system, non-diff notes as `kind: "comment"` entries. System notes ("added label", "approved
  this merge request", "mentioned in !12") are excluded — they are audit noise in GitHub terms,
  which never surfaces them either. There is no `kind: "review"` entry (no review object to
  back it); instead `GitLabMergeRequestDetails.approvedBy?: GitLabActor[]` comes from
  `GET …/approvals`, omitted when GitLab will not answer that read (an empty list would claim
  nobody approved). Diff-anchored discussions are `readDiffThreads()`'s domain, as on GitHub.
- **Provisional references are kind-aware.** GitHub rewrites `#~N` → `#N`. GitLab references
  issues as `#N` and merge requests as `!N`, so `~N` is a provisional *issue* when written `#~N`
  and a provisional *MR* when written `!~N`; both grammars are rewritten on apply, each against
  its own kind's `provisional:*` record, and both are matched as whole tokens
  (`PROVISIONAL_REFERENCE`): `#~1` is in neither `#~10` nor `#~1a`, for the rewrite and the
  reject cascade (§6) alike. `getIssue("~1")` and `getMergeRequest("~1")` are disjoint lookups,
  as they are on GitHub.
- **Quick actions never run.** GitLab runs a line of a note, description or published draft that
  starts with `/name` as a quick action on the issue or merge request, with the user's full
  authority (its scope check limits only `ai_workflows` tokens): `/approve` publishes the user's
  parked drafts and approves with no head bound, `/move` and `/clone` take an issue and its thread
  out of the bound project, and none of it is what the approver agreed to. `#postedText`, the one
  transform every posted text passes through, escapes each such line with a leading backslash
  (`escapeQuickActions`), which renders as nothing in text and shows in code, where GitLab would
  not have run the line. Skipping code instead would have to follow the instance's version:
  current releases find paragraphs with a Markdown pipeline, 16.x scans one regex that knows only
  column-one ``` fences, so a `~~~` fence hides a command from one and not the other. Reads
  simulate with the same text, and the approval card says the backslash is added. `/merge` was
  never the risk: it needs the `merge_request_diff_head_sha` parameter, which nothing sends.
  GitHub has no analogue.
- **Assignees are usernames, resolved at prepare time.** GitLab's create/update APIs take
  `assignee_ids`; the agent-facing API takes usernames (what agents see in results and URLs).
  `prepareCreateIssue` and `prepareCreateMergeRequest` resolve each via `GET /users?username=` —
  a read that only prepares the action, so no observation (upstream #593) — and fail fast on an
  unknown one, so the queued action already carries ids and apply cannot fail on a typo the
  agent could have fixed.
- **Caching is TTL-only with the conditional-GET structure retained.** GitLab REST does not
  reliably send `ETag`s; the `Cached<T>.etag` field stays optional and the `#loadCachedWithEtag`
  helper stays (a 304 path that is simply never taken is cheaper to review than a re-shaped cache
  layer), but no test asserts on 304 behaviour and TTLs do the work.
- **Redirects are never followed; a 3xx from the API is "the project has moved" or "Access
  answered".** The docs' "Redirects" section says a renamed or transferred project answers at its
  old path with `301` and a `Location` naming the *numeric-id* URL. A default `fetch` follows
  that — and per the Fetch spec a followed 301 turns a `POST` into a `GET`, so `createIssue` on a
  moved project would silently become an issue *listing* and report success. `request()`
  therefore uses `redirect: "manual"` and maps any 3xx to a `GitLabApiError`, choosing its
  message by the `Location`'s *path*: `/api/v4/…` is the rename (re-bind the connection), anything
  else is an access proxy answering instead of GitLab (the service token is not admitted). By
  path rather than host because GitLab spells the rename's `Location` with its configured
  external URL — the browser-facing host — which differs from the requested host exactly in the
  split-hostname Access layout this gatekeeper exists for. (Following redirects only for GET
  was considered and rejected: a moved project should be re-bound once, not read through a stale
  path forever.) The OAuth form posts and the git smart-HTTP requests use the same setting: a
  302 there is Access or a login page, not GitLab, and the error should say so rather than quote
  the login page or fail in the pkt-line parser.
- **Tree-by-oid has no REST fallback; the simulation degrades.** GitHub's simulated MR diff over
  queued pushes falls back to `GET /git/trees/{sha}` when a tree isn't in the workspace cache.
  GitLab's tree endpoint is path-and-ref addressed, not oid addressed, so `TreeDiffSource.getTree`
  returns `null` for a tree the cache lacks and the existing `TreeUnavailableError` path degrades
  the read to the remote (un-simulated) details with a warn log — the failure mode GitHub already
  handles. Blobs by oid *are* available (`GET /repository/blobs/:sha`). Pulling a missing tree
  through the gatekeeper's own upload-pack path is feasible — the docs list
  `uploadpack.allowAnySHA1InWant` among Gitaly-set values and partial clone needs it — but punted
  for scope.
- **A thread is read whole from the discussions endpoint, not incrementally from notes.** The
  first design mirrored GitHub's incremental discussion sync onto GitLab's notes endpoint (a
  watermark walk over `order_by=updated_at&sort=desc`, since notes have no `since`). Review
  caught what the docs say plainly: "items of type DiscussionNote are not returned as part of the
  Note API" — the notes listing omits every *reply*, so `readDiscussion()` would have shown only
  the first comment of every thread. The discussions endpoint has the replies but takes no
  `order_by`, `sort`, or `since` at all, so there is nothing to sync incrementally against.
  `readDiscussion()` therefore reads every discussion (cached 30 s, the same fetch
  `readDiffThreads()` already makes), flattens the notes, drops GitLab's `system` activity and,
  on a merge request, the diff-anchored *discussions*, and orders oldest first. The split between
  the two reads is decided per discussion by its root note's `position` (`diffAnchor`), not per
  note by `type`: a reply inherits its thread's anchor whether or not GitLab repeats `position`
  on it, and a per-note rule would have shown a diff thread's replies in both reads. A very long thread costs
  pages of `per_page=100`, not correctness; if it shows up, the remedy is a bounded window over
  the flattened list, not the notes endpoint.
- **`baseSha` means the target branch head at diff time; `mergeBaseSha` means the merge base.**
  These are GitHub's field meanings and they are kept — but GitLab's `diff_refs` names them the
  other way round (`base_sha` = merge base, `start_sha` = target head). The mapping is
  `start_sha → baseSha`, `base_sha → mergeBaseSha`, `head_sha → headSha`, written once in one
  helper (`revisionFromDiffRefs`) with a test that pins it, because this inversion is the single
  most likely bug in the port.

  entrypoint (nonce-gated connect URL → `authorize` redirect; `/oauth` callback → `acceptAuthCode`
  → `connectHandoffPageHtml`), `GatekeeperVendor`, `UserAccount` DO (single non-expiring token,
  `stagedCredentials` for reconnect via `gatekeeper-kit/credential-stage`), `GatekeeperUserImpl`
  (`getGatekeeperClassFor` parses `owner/repo[/issues|pull/N]`), `GitHubVerifier`
  (`hasRepoAccess`), `GitHubGatekeeperImpl` DO (caches, action records, provisional ids,
  overlays, discussion/review-comment sync state, branch-head simulation, tree-diff source,
  `gitPull`, `applyAction`/`rejectAction`/`revertAction`, strategy-B `addObserver`), session
  `RpcTarget`s (`GitHubRepoSessionImpl`, `GitHubIssueImpl`, `GitHubPullRequestImpl`) with
  `SessionGitCache`/`AdvertisingCursor`. `github-api.ts` (1.4k lines) is the HTTP client:
  `request()` with bearer/basic auth, `*Conditional` GETs, OAuth exchange/revoke, and the two
  smart-HTTP POSTs. `storage-schema.md` documents the DO key layout (partly stale: it says
  `pendingAction:` where the code uses `action:`; the GitLab one will be written from the code).
- **Git contract** (`workshop-shared/src/gatekeeper.ts`): `GitOid`, `GitObjectType`,
  `GitCache` (`get`/`has`/`stat`/`put`/`advertiseCommit`/`buildPack`/`consumePack`/`isAncestor`),
  `GitPullHints`, `Gatekeeper.gitPull?(oids, cache, hints)`, `Gatekeeper.applyAction(action,
  cache)`, `ActionDescription.pushedCommits`, `ObservationAuthorizer.getGitCache()`. The
  overseer pulls from `meta.onRemote[0] ?? meta.pullableFrom[0]` (`overseer.ts` ~2370), i.e.
  from whichever gatekeeper advertised or proved the object — which is why every commit-id-bearing
  read must advertise. The agent-facing worktree API is `workshop-backend/src/worktree-binding.d.ts`.
- **Git layer** (`gatekeeper-github/src/git-{transport,commits,diff}.ts`): pkt-line codec,
  protocol-v2 fetch composer (`buildGitFetchRequest`, `filterSpecForHints`, no `have`s),
  sideband demux → `GitPackSink.consumePack`, `pullGitObjectsIntoCache(fetchUploadPack, oids,
  hints, cache)`, classic receive-pack composer (`buildRefUpdateRequest`, `report-status` only, no
  side-band), `pushGitRefUpdate(fetchReceivePack, update, pack)`, `GitRefUpdateRejectedError`,
  `emptyPackBytes`; git commit/tree object parsers; `diffGitTrees`/`diffTextLines` over a
  `TreeDiffSource`. Only their doc comments mention GitHub.
- **Kit** (`packages/gatekeeper-kit`): leaf modules with explicit subpath exports, JSDoc on every
  public symbol, README inventory, node tests for pure logic (`AGENTS.md` there). No git code
  today. Dependencies: `backend-utils`, `workshop-shared`, `jose`.
- **Registration is name-derived and config-gated.** `run-dev-server.ts` and
  `manifest-lib.ts:readDeployablePackages` pick up any `packages/gatekeeper-*` with a
  `wrangler.jsonc`; the backend and router discover `GATEKEEPER_*` bindings by prefix; the router
  forwards `/gatekeeper/gitlab/*` to the worker; `BASE_URL` is `…/gatekeeper/gitlab` in dev and
  `$PUBLIC_BASE_URL/gatekeeper/gitlab` in the manifest. `manifest-lib.test.ts` requires a fixture
  bundle per deployable package (`scripts/release/testdata/fixture-bundles/<pkg>/*.js`) and a
  golden regen. `run-dev-server.ts:SHARED_GATEKEEPER_CREDS` maps `<VENDOR>_CLIENT_ID/SECRET` dev
  env vars into `CLIENT_ID`/`CLIENT_SECRET`.
- **Configurator runtime** (`packages/configurator-ui`): `Autocomplete`/`TextInput`/`Field`/
  `Section`; spec `{initial, initialValuesFromResourceUrl?, isReady?, resourceUrl, render}`;
  `resourceUrl()` and `initialValuesFromResourceUrl()` both receive the `ui` capability, which is
  how a GitLab configurator learns the instance URL (GitHub's hardcode `https://github.com/`).
  UI modules are transpiled per file with only `@gadgets/configurator-ui` and type-only imports
  stripped, so they can't import runtime helpers.
- **Resource resolution is first-match** (`resolveRequestedResource` in `gatekeeper.ts`;
  `user.ts:281` for filters), against `SupportedResource.urlPattern` via `URLPattern`, with a
  trailing-slash tolerance wrapper.
- **The internal stub** (`gadgets-internal/packages/gatekeeper-gitlab`): read-only
  `searchIssues`/`searchMergeRequests`/`searchProjects`, PKCE + rotating refresh (unlocked),
  service-token headers on every upstream request, a separate API hostname, strategy-C observers
  from `gatekeeper-shared/observers`, path-prefix scoping, a free-text path configurator, inbound
  Access-JWT check, migration `v0: [UserAccount, GitLabGatekeeperImpl]`. Its plumbing (which
  upstream hostname, which headers) is the specification for §2's instance configuration.
- **How the internal deployment consumes public gatekeepers**: it discovers them in the
  submodule (`findGatekeepers(PUBLIC_PACKAGES_DIR)`), generates `wrangler.prod.jsonc` /
  `wrangler.staging.jsonc` from `PACKAGE_OVERRIDES[pkg]` (`vars` included, flowing to staging
  too), and — because its Vault→secret CI component can't reach submodule packages — gives each
  OAuth gatekeeper a dedicated deploy job that deploys then `wrangler secret put`s from Vault
  (the zoominfo/slack pattern). Its submodule currently predates `gatekeeper-kit` entirely.

## Design

### 1. Kit extraction (gatekeeper-kit + gatekeeper-github)

- `packages/gatekeeper-kit/src/git-transport.ts` — `git-transport.ts` verbatim. Comment edits
  only: the module header's "came from GitHub over TLS" and `filterSpecForHints`'s "GitHub
  rejects" become "the upstream" / "verified live against GitHub; other servers may accept more,
  and honouring them is an optimisation, not a correctness change". Export list unchanged.
- `packages/gatekeeper-kit/src/git-objects.ts` — from `git-commits.ts`: `isCommitOid`,
  `ParsedGitCommit` (over a new neutral `GitCommitIdentity = {name?, email?, date?}`),
  `parseGitCommitPayload`, `parseGitIdentity`, `commitDetailsFromGitObject(oid, payload,
  commitUrl: (oid) => string)` returning a neutral `GitCommitDetails` (no `authorAccount`),
  `CommitAdvertiser`, `advertiseCommits`, and `advertisePages(advertiser, commitIds,
  {withhold})` — the per-page advertising hook that replaces github's `CommitAdvertisingCursor`,
  recording an id only once its advertisement resolves. The hook runs on the kit's generic
  `PageHookCursor` (`./cursors`, an `RpcTarget`), which serializes calls and holds a page whose
  hook threw so that a retry re-offers it. `parseGitIdentity`'s pattern, `^(.*?)\s*<`, let the
  lazy name and `\s*` both consume the same run of spaces (CodeQL `js/polynomial-redos`); it is
  now `^([^<]*)<` with the name's trailing whitespace trimmed afterwards — git itself strips
  angle brackets from names, so nothing well-formed reads differently.
- `packages/gatekeeper-kit/src/git-diff.ts` — `git-diff.ts` with `GitDiffFile`/`GitDiffHunk`/
  `GitDiffLine`; `TreeDiffSource`, `diffGitTrees` (returning `TreeDiffFile`: the statuses a tree
  walk produces, so a provider that never reports `"copied"` can say so),
  `changedPathsBetweenTrees`, `diffTextLines`, `parseGitTreePayload`, `treeEntryKind`, the three
  `MAX_*` constants, `TreeUnavailableError`. Kit `package.json` gains `"diff": "catalog:"`.
- Subpath exports `./git-transport`, `./git-objects`, `./git-diff`; README inventory rows; JSDoc
  already present, audited for the "every public symbol" rule. `__tests__/git-transport.test.ts`,
  `git-diff.test.ts`, and the object-parsing half of `git-commits.test.ts` move to the kit's node
  project; the `normalize*` half stays in github.
- `gatekeeper-github`: delete `git-transport.ts` and `git-diff.ts`; import from the kit;
  `types.d.ts` is untouched (its `GitHubPullRequestDiff*` types are structurally identical to the
  kit's, and the `.d.ts` served to agents must stay self-contained); `git-commits.ts` shrinks to
  the REST adapters + `actorFromUser` + a `commitDetailsFromGitObject` wrapper that supplies
  GitHub's `/commit/` URL and `authorAccount: null`; `AdvertisingCursor` goes —
  `SessionGitCache.wrap` is the `advertisePages` hook on a `PageHookCursor`, and the
  simulated-commit filter each call site repeated becomes its `withhold` option.

### 2. Instance configuration and the HTTP layer (gitlab-api.ts)

- `Env` adds `GITLAB_URL?`, `GITLAB_API_URL?`, `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID?`, `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET?`
  beside `BASE_URL`, `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`. Three pure helpers in `gitlab.ts`:
  `instanceUrl(env)` (browser-facing origin, trailing slashes stripped, default
  `https://gitlab.com`), `apiOrigin(env)` (`GITLAB_API_URL ?? instanceUrl`), and
  `upstreamHeaders(env)` (`{}` or the two `CF-Access-*` headers). `GitLabApi`'s constructor takes
  `{apiOrigin, headers, getToken}` so tests construct it against a mock origin, and so the
  `GatekeeperUserImpl`/DO/verifier all build it the same way (`#api()` helper).
- `request()` mirrors github's: `Accept: application/json`, `User-Agent: Cloudflare-Gadgets`,
  bearer auth via `getToken`, `AbortSignal.timeout(30s)`, `okStatuses`, **`redirect: "manual"`**
  (3xx → "project moved" or "an access proxy answered"; see the locked decision), and error-body
  parsing that handles the three documented shapes — `{"message": "404 …"}`, the validation hash
  `{"message": {"field": ["…"]}}`, and OAuth-style `{"error", "error_description"}` — into
  `GitLabApiError { status, details, isAuthError }`, `isAuthError` marking a `401`
  from `GET /user` or a git endpoint, the only requests whose 401 is about the credential (see
  the credential decision); a `429` appends the documented `Retry-After`. Project paths are passed
  already URL-encoded
  (`encodeURIComponent(pathWithNamespace)`) — GitLab's `:id` is either the numeric id or the
  encoded full path, and we always use the path; branch and tag names are encoded whole, slashes
  included, per the docs' `my%2Fbranch` rule. Pagination follows GitLab's `x-next-page` (empty
  on the last page), not GitHub's "short page means exhausted" rule: listings that filter after
  paginating — notes and discussions drop what the reader may not see — return short pages with
  more behind them, so listings answer `GitLabPage {items, nextPage}` and the `StreamingCursor`
  reads `nextPage`, not the length; only a response carrying no `x-next-page` at all falls back
  to the short-page rule. `x-total`/`x-total-pages` are no help: the docs omit them above 10,000
  results and on the Commits API always. Every body is read through the kit's byte cap
  (`readTextCapped`), error bodies included.
- **OAuth helpers**: `buildAuthorizeUrl(instanceUrl, {clientId, redirectUri, scopes, state,
  codeChallenge})`, `exchangeAuthCode(apiOrigin, headers, {code, clientId, clientSecret,
  redirectUri, codeVerifier})` → `GitLabOAuthGrant { accessToken, refreshToken, expiresAt }`
  (`expiresAt` from the response's `expires_in` — never a hard-coded 7200, since admins can
  change it from 19.1; the documented response has no `scope` field, so requested scopes are
  recorded by the caller), `refreshAccessToken(...)` (no `redirect_uri`; see the OAuth decision)
  → grant, throwing the kit's `CredentialsExpiredError` on a 4xx other than 429 whose body is
  `error: "invalid_grant"` and an ordinary error otherwise, `revokeToken(apiOrigin, headers,
  token, clientId, clientSecret)` (called for both tokens — the docs don't say revoking one
  revokes the other), and
  `fetchCurrentUser(apiOrigin, headers, token)` → `{ username, name, avatarUrl, email?,
  confirmedAt? }` for both `describe()` and `getAuthenticatedEmail()`. All POSTs are
  `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.
- **Endpoint mapping** (GitHub → GitLab v4; `P` = URL-encoded project path):

  | Purpose | GitHub | GitLab |
  |---|---|---|
  | viewer | `GET /user` | `GET /user` |
  | verified email | `GET /user/emails` | `GET /user` (`email` when `confirmed_at` non-null; `userinfo` rejected — its `email` needs a *public* email) |
  | project metadata | `GET /repos/{o}/{r}` | `GET /projects/P` (`path_with_namespace`, `namespace.full_path`, `default_branch`, `visibility`, `description`, `web_url`, `permissions`) |
  | project access probe | same | `GET /user` for the observer's id, then `GET /projects/P/members/all?user_ids[]=` (effective membership at its highest level; `[]` for a non-member, 404 for a hidden project) — never `permissions`, which omits inherited access (§8) |
  | configurator: my projects | `GET /user/repos`, `GET /search/repositories` | `GET /projects?membership=true&search=&search_namespaces=true&order_by=last_activity_at&simple=true` |
  | issue | `GET …/issues/{n}` | `GET /projects/P/issues/{iid}?with_labels_details=true` |
  | list / search issues | `GET …/issues`, `GET /search/issues` | `GET /projects/P/issues?state&labels&author_username&assignee_username[]&order_by&sort&search&with_labels_details=true` (`search` covers title+description; the project endpoint has no `in`; `order_by` ∈ `created_at`, `updated_at`, `popularity`, …) |
  | create issue | `POST …/issues` | `POST /projects/P/issues {title, description, labels, assignee_ids}` (multiple assignees are Premium/Ultimate; Free honours one) |
  | title / body / state | `PATCH …/issues/{n}` | `PUT /projects/P/issues/{iid} {title, description, state_event: close\|reopen}` |
  | labels | `POST`/`PUT …/labels` | `PUT /projects/P/issues/{iid} {add_labels, remove_labels}` |
  | notes list | `GET …/comments?since` | `GET /projects/P/issues/{iid}/discussions`, read whole and flattened (the notes listing omits every reply; see the locked decision) |
  | note create / edit / delete | `POST`/`PATCH`/`DELETE …/comments` | `POST`/`PUT`/`DELETE /projects/P/issues/{iid}/notes[/{id}]` |
  | resolve username | — | `GET /users?username=` |
  | MR | `GET …/pulls/{n}` | `GET /projects/P/merge_requests/{iid}?with_labels_details=true` (`diff_refs`, `sha`, `draft`, `has_conflicts`, `detailed_merge_status`, `changes_count` (string, `"1000+"` when capped), `source_project_id`/`target_project_id`, `reviewers`, `user.can_merge`, `blocking_discussions_resolved`; `diff_refs`/`changes_count` are single-GET only and empty until populated asynchronously after create) |
  | MR approvals | `GET …/reviews` | `GET /projects/P/merge_requests/{iid}/approvals` (`approved_by[].user`; Free tier) |
  | list / search MRs | `GET …/pulls` + client-side scan | `GET /projects/P/merge_requests?state&source_branch&target_branch&labels&author_username&assignee_username[]&wip=yes\|no&order_by&sort&search&in` (`wip` works everywhere; the `draft` boolean filter is 19.0+ and `wip` is deprecated there — switch when the floor allows) |
  | create MR | `POST …/pulls` | `POST /projects/P/merge_requests {source_branch, target_branch, title, description, remove_source_branch, squash}` (no `draft` param exists — `Draft:` title prefix; recognised prefixes `Draft:`, `[Draft]`, `(Draft)`) |
  | MR title / body / state / labels | issue endpoints | `PUT /projects/P/merge_requests/{iid}` (same fields as issues) |
  | MR notes | issue comments | `GET`/`POST …/merge_requests/{iid}/notes` (`type: null \| DiscussionNote \| DiffNote`, `system`) |
  | diff threads | `GET …/pulls/{n}/comments` | `GET …/merge_requests/{iid}/discussions` (notes with `position`, `resolvable`, `resolved`) |
  | submit review | `POST …/pulls/{n}/reviews` | approve: `POST …/approve {sha}` first (409 on a stale `sha`); `POST …/draft_notes {note, position[…]}` ×N; then requestChanges: `POST …/draft_notes/bulk_publish {reviewer_state: requested_changes}` (19.2+), comment/approve: `PUT …/draft_notes/{id}/publish` each; the summary as `POST …/notes`. `GET …/draft_notes` is one unpaginated list |
  | reply to thread | `POST …/comments/{id}/replies` | `POST …/discussions/{discussion_id}/notes {body}` |
  | delete diff note | `DELETE /pulls/comments/{id}` | `DELETE …/merge_requests/{iid}/notes/{id}` |
  | MR files | `GET …/pulls/{n}/files` | `GET …/merge_requests/{iid}/diffs?page&per_page` (`diff`, `old_path`, `new_path`, `a_mode`, `b_mode`, `new_file`, `renamed_file`, `deleted_file`, `generated_file`, `too_large`, `collapsed` (18.4+); `changes` is deprecated since 15.7) |
  | MR commits | `GET …/pulls/{n}/commits` | `GET …/merge_requests/{iid}/commits` |
  | merge | `PUT …/pulls/{n}/merge` | `PUT …/merge_requests/{iid}/merge {squash, squash_commit_message, merge_commit_message, should_remove_source_branch, sha}` — documented codes: 405 cannot merge, 409 `sha` mismatch, 422 branch cannot be merged, 401 no permission (no 406) |
  | compare | `GET …/compare/{b}...{h}` | `GET /projects/P/repository/compare?from&to` (`commits` always complete; `diffs` may be incomplete when `compare_timeout`; **no merge base in the response**) |
  | merge base | `merge_base_commit` on compare | `GET /projects/P/repository/merge_base?refs[]=&refs[]=` |
  | branches | `GET …/branches[/{name}]` | `GET /projects/P/repository/branches[/{name}]?search` (`commit.id`, `protected`, `default`, `can_push`; name encoded whole, `feature%2Fx`) |
  | tags | `GET …/tags` | `GET /projects/P/repository/tags` (use `commit.id` — for annotated tags `target` is the tag object) |
  | commit / resolve ref | `GET …/commits/{ref}` (+ `sha` media type) | `GET /projects/P/repository/commits/{ref}` (branch or tag name, or sha — abbreviated resolution is implied by the docs' own `merge_base` example, confirmed live; `id`, `parent_ids`, `author_*`, `committer_*`, `stats` on single GET; no sha-only media type, so `resolveRef` and `getCommit` share one cached read) |
  | history | `GET …/commits?sha&path&author&since&until` | `GET /projects/P/repository/commits?ref_name&path&author&since&until&first_parent` (never returns `x-total`) |
  | tree by oid | `GET …/git/trees/{sha}` | **none** (path+ref only) |
  | blob by oid | `GET …/git/blobs/{sha}` | `GET /projects/P/repository/blobs/{sha}` (`size`, base64 `content`) |
  | git fetch | `POST github.com/{o}/{r}.git/git-upload-pack`, Basic `x-access-token:` | `POST {apiOrigin}/{path}.git/git-upload-pack`, Basic `oauth2:<token>` (the documented username), `Git-Protocol: version=2` (v2 "enabled by default in GitLab for HTTP requests") |
  | git push | `…/git-receive-pack` | same host/auth, classic protocol; requires the `write_repository` scope |
  | authorize | `github.com/login/oauth/authorize` | `{instanceUrl}/oauth/authorize?response_type=code&scope=&state=&code_challenge=&code_challenge_method=S256` |
  | token / refresh / revoke | `…/login/oauth/access_token`, `DELETE /applications/{id}/token` | `{apiOrigin}/oauth/token` (`grant_type=authorization_code` + `code_verifier` + `redirect_uri`; `grant_type=refresh_token`), `{apiOrigin}/oauth/revoke {client_id, client_secret, token}` |

  Every cell above is taken from the current GitLab documentation (see [Verification](#verification)).
  The `author` history filter and `with_labels_details` carry no "introduced in" note on the
  current pages, which means they predate the docs' history window (~3 major versions) and are
  safe on any supported instance; the version-gated items are listed under Verification.

### 3. Accounts and OAuth (UserAccount, GatekeeperVendor, GatekeeperUserImpl)

- **Connect URL and callback** exactly as GitHub's: `connectAccount()` mints a `UserAccount`,
  stores `callback`, `requestedScopes`, `ephemeral`, an initiation nonce with a 10-minute
  lifetime and a 1-hour self-destruct alarm, and returns `${BASE_URL}/${doId}/${nonce}`. Visiting
  it → `beginOAuthFlow()` swaps in an OAuth-stage nonce **and generates the PKCE verifier**
  (stored beside the nonce, one per flow) → 302 to `{instanceUrl}/oauth/authorize` with
  `state = ${doId}:${oauthNonce}`, `code_challenge`, `code_challenge_method=S256`, `scope`.
  The `state` and `redirect_uri` come from the kit's `PreviewOAuth` (as in `gatekeeper-google`):
  with none of `OAUTH_ALLOW_PREVIEW_REDIRECTS` / `OAUTH_REDIRECT_URI` /
  `OAUTH_STATE_SIGNING_SECRET` set — production — that is the plain `doId:nonce` state and this
  Worker's own callback; on a Worker Preview, whose hostname the GitLab application cannot list,
  it is a signed state carrying the preview's callback and the *stable* Worker's redirect, and
  the stable Worker's `/oauth` relays GitLab's answer (code or error) to the preview. The
  `redirect_uri` the authorize request carried is stored on the `oauth`-stage nonce and repeated
  verbatim in the code exchange (RFC 6749 §4.1.3). Added for the internal deployment's MR
  previews; `gatekeeper-github` does not have it yet (Punted).
  `/oauth` callback → `acceptAuthCode(code, oauthNonce)` verifies the nonce in constant time,
  deletes it and the verifier, exchanges the code (with `code_verifier`), and either stages the
  grant (`reconnect` flows → `stageCredentials` → `callback.reconnectComplete(stageId)`) or writes
  it live and calls `callback.complete(GatekeeperUserImpl({props}))`, clearing *and revoking* the
  grant if that throws -- the pair stored then, which the Workshop describing the account may have
  rotated -- since tokens the Workshop never took are held by nobody; the browser lands
  on `connectHandoffPageHtml`. Auth-only grants set the 2-minute alarm. All from
  `gatekeeper-kit/connect-pages` and `credential-stage`; nothing hand-rolled. A connect link or
  callback state whose id is not one of this Worker's accounts gets the invalid-link page or a
  400 (`accountFor`), not an exception.
- **Grant storage**: the coordinator's `credentials` record (`{ accessToken, refreshToken,
  expiresAt, scopes }`) and its `credentials:*` fence keys, `user` (`{ id, generation }`),
  `expiredNotified` (kit latch), `stagedCredentials` (kit key, `{ grant, startedUnder }`).
  `commitReconnect(stageId)` writes the staged grant, or revokes it when the connection it was
  staged to replace is no longer the live one. The scope guard lives in `ensureResources()`, not
  `getAccessToken()`: a grant whose recorded `scopes` (missing → empty) lack `api` or
  `write_repository` is answered with the `reconnect()` URL, and reads the grant can serve are
  never refused (auth-only grants never get here — they're consumed via `getAuthenticatedEmail`
  and destroyed).
- **Refresh** per the locked decision: the coordinator's `snapshot` and `adjudicateRejection`,
  both given the same `refresh` (`refreshAccessToken`, with no cooldown: the coordinator already
  redeems once for every waiting caller, so a transient failure is retried by the next request),
  so a refused live token is refreshed past; `notify` is `notifyCredentialsExpiredOnce`. `revoke()`
  clears the coordinator before its first await, `deleteAll()`s, then revokes both tokens (the
  docs don't say revoking one revokes its partner), logging failures.
- **`GatekeeperVendor.describe()`**: `displayName: "GitLab"`, `url: instanceUrl(env)`, the
  GitLab logo (from the internal stub's `gitlab-logo.svg`), `tagline: "Triage issues, review
  merge requests, and push to projects"`, `providesAuth: true`.
- **`GatekeeperUserImpl`**: `describe()` from `GET /user` (`name`, `username`, `avatar_url`);
  `getAuthenticatedEmail()` from the same `GET /user`: `email` when `confirmed_at` is non-null,
  else `null`; `getSupportedResources()`
  builds the three patterns from `instanceUrl(env)`; `getGatekeeperClassFor(url)` requires the
  URL's origin to equal `instanceUrl(env)`, splits the path on `/-/`, takes the left side as
  `projectPath` (≥ 2 segments) and the right side as `issues/N` | `merge_requests/N` | nothing →
  `resourceKind: "issue" | "mergeRequest" | "project"`; `startResourceConfigurator` per pattern;
  `reconnect()`/`commitReconnect()`/`revoke()`/`ensureResources()` as GitHub; `getVerifier()`
  mints `GitLabVerifier({props: {userObjectId}})`.

### 4. Resources, URL patterns, DO props, configurators

- Patterns (built at call time from `instanceUrl`), **ordered most-specific first** because
  `resolveRequestedResource` is first-match and `:project+` also matches the longer URLs:
  1. `{instanceUrl}/:project+/-/merge_requests/:iid` — "GitLab Merge Request"
  2. `{instanceUrl}/:project+/-/issues/:iid` — "GitLab Issue"
  3. `{instanceUrl}/:project+` — "GitLab Project"
  `getGatekeeperClassFor` is authoritative regardless of which pattern the UI picked. A test
  pins the ordering by resolving an MR URL and asserting the MR resource.
- `GitLabGatekeeperImplProps = { userObjectId, resourceKind: "project" | "issue" | "mergeRequest",
  projectPath, iid? }`. `projectPath` is the full `path_with_namespace` (never the numeric id —
  it's what appears in URLs and what the observer probe needs). `#projectRef()` builds
  `GitLabProjectRef { path, name, namespace, url }` from it.
- **Configurators** mirror GitHub's three, with two GitLab adaptations. `GitLabProjectConfiguratorUI.
  listProjects(query)` uses the membership listing (empty query) or `search=` +
  `search_namespaces=true` (non-empty), and falls back to an exact `GET /projects/P` when the query
  parses as a path or an instance URL (`parseProjectPath`, which splits on `/-/` and strips the
  instance origin). Issue and MR UIs add an `Autocomplete` fed by the `search=` listings, with
  `#N`/`!N` numeric fallbacks. Because the UI module can't read env, the `ui` capability gains
  `instanceUrl(): Promise<string>`, and both `resourceUrl()` and `initialValuesFromResourceUrl()`
  use it (`resourceUrl` is allowed to be async; `initialValuesFromResourceUrl` can also derive the
  origin from `resourceUrlPattern`). Round-trip test: `resourceUrl(initialValuesFromResourceUrl(u))
  === u` for nested-group URLs.

### 5. Session API (`types.d.ts`) — the review artifact

`types.d.ts` is written first and reviewed before §6 begins (the write-gatekeeper skill's API
gate; it applies within a single PR as a review checkpoint on the commit). It is GitHub's
`types.d.ts` transposed, method for method, with this divergence table as its changelog. JSDoc
follows the skill's rule: what the method does, parameters, result shape, errors — no approval
queue, no caching, no OAuth.

| GitHub | GitLab | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `GitHubRepo` / `GitHubRepoRef {owner, name, fullName, url}` | `GitLabProject` / `GitLabProjectRef {path, name, namespace, url}` | nested namespaces; `owner` has no meaning |
| `GitHubPullRequest`, `createPullRequest`, `getPullRequest`, `listPullRequests`, `searchPullRequests` | `GitLabMergeRequest`, `createMergeRequest`, `getMergeRequest`, `listMergeRequests`, `searchMergeRequests` | vocabulary |
| `head` / `base` (`GitHubPullRequestBranchRef {ref, sha, repo}`) | `source` / `target` (`GitLabBranchRef {branch, sha: string \| null, project}`) | vocabulary; forks via `source_project_id`; `sha` is `null` where GitLab does not say (a listing's target head, a pending MR's unreadable branch), never an empty string that reads as a commit id |
| `GitHubIssueState = "open" \| "closed"` | issues `"opened" \| "closed"`; MRs `GitLabMergeRequestState = "opened" \| "closed" \| "merged" \| "locked"` | GitLab states; `merged` is a state, not `merged: boolean` |
| `close(reason?: "completed" \| "notPlanned")` | `close()` | no `state_reason` |
| `GitHubPullRequestSummary.merged: boolean`, `.draft` | `state === "merged"`; `draft` kept | as above |
| `createPullRequest({head, base, draft})` | `createMergeRequest({sourceBranch, targetBranch, draft, labels?, assignees?, removeSourceBranch?, squash?})` | GitLab MR options; labels and assignees as `createIssue` takes them (reviewers: Punted) |
| `merge({method, commitTitle, commitMessage, expectedHeadSha})` | `merge({squash?, removeSourceBranch?, commitMessage?, squashCommitMessage?, expectedHeadSha?})` | merge method is a project setting |
| `GitHubReviewDecision = "comment" \| "approve" \| "requestChanges"` | same three values | `requestChanges` is `bulk_publish`'s `reviewer_state: requested_changes` (19.2+); `comment` and `approve` publish draft by draft and record no reviewer state (locked decision); "requested changes" blocks merging only on Premium/Ultimate 17.2+ (JSDoc says so) |
| `GitHubDiscussionEntry` `kind: "comment" \| "review"` | `kind: "comment"` only; `GitLabMergeRequestDetails.approvedBy?: GitLabActor[]` | no review object; approvals are metadata, omitted when unreadable |
| `GitHubDiffThread {id, target, isOutdated, isResolved?, comments}` | same shape; `isOutdated` becomes `isOutdated?` computed as `position.head_sha !== diff_refs.head_sha` | REST has no outdated flag; documented as approximate |
| `replyToDiffComment(commentId, body)` | same signature | note id → discussion id resolved internally |
| — | `resolveDiffThread(threadId)` / `unresolveDiffThread(threadId)` | GitLab-native, cheap (`PUT …/discussions/:id?resolved=`); both are actions |
| `GitHubDiffCommentTarget` line/file, `side: "old" \| "new"`, `startLine` | same shape | maps to `position{base_sha, start_sha, head_sha, old_path, new_path, old_line, new_line, line_range}`; `position_type: "text" \| "file"` (both documented, no version gate); both paths are always required; multi-line needs `line_range.start/end.{line_code, type}` where `line_code = sha1(path) + "_" + old + "_" + new` — computed in the DO |
| `GitHubPullRequestDetails.mergeable?`, `requestedReviewers`, `commits`, `additions`, `deletions`, `changedFiles` | `mergeStatus: string` (`detailed_merge_status`, 25 documented values), `hasConflicts`, `canMerge` (`user.can_merge`), `reviewers`, `approvedBy`, `changedFiles?` (from `changes_count`: a string, `"1000+"` when capped → `1000` with `changedFilesTruncated: true`; `undefined` while GitLab is still populating it after create); **no `additions`/`deletions` on details** | MR JSON has no line counts; `readDiff()` still reports per-file counts |
| `GitHubCommitSummary.authorAccount` | dropped | commit JSON has no linked account |
| `GitHubIssueFilter.sort: "created" \| "updated" \| "comments"` | issues `"created" \| "updated" \| "popularity"`; MRs `"created" \| "updated"` | GitLab `order_by` (`popularity` = upvotes; `merged_at` is 17.2+ and left out) |
| `GitHubPullRequestFilter.head: "user:ref"` | `sourceBranch: string`, `targetBranch: string` | no cross-fork branch spec in the list filter |
| `GitHubPullRequestSearch.merged?: boolean` | folded into `state` | `merged` is a state |

| `GitHubPullRequestRevision {baseSha, headSha, mergeBaseSha?}` | `GitLabMergeRequestRevision` same names, same meanings | mapped from `diff_refs` via `revisionFromDiffRefs` (see locked decision) |
| `GitHubPullRequestDiffFile`/`Hunk`/`Line` | `GitLabDiffFile`/`Hunk`/`Line` = kit's `GitDiffFile`/…, with no `"copied"` status | shared; GitLab never reports a copy |

Everything else — `Cursor<T>`, page options, `listBranches`/`listTags`/`resolveRef`/`getCommit`/
`listCommits`/`push` on the project, `getDetails`/`setTitle`/`setBody`/`addLabels`/
`removeLabels`/`reopen`/`readDiscussion`/`postComment` on issues, `readDiff`/`readDiffThreads`/
`postReview`/`listCommits`/`getMergeBase` on MRs, the worktree-oriented JSDoc ("mount a commit as
a worktree", "push then createMergeRequest back to back") — is GitHub's text with the nouns
swapped.

### 6. Gatekeeper DO: caching, actions, simulation (GitLabGatekeeperImpl)

Structure and method inventory follow `GitHubGatekeeperImpl` one-for-one; the private-method list
in `github.ts` is the checklist. Divergences:

- **Action union** — same members with GitLab names: `createIssue`, `createMergeRequest`,
  `setTitle`, `setBody`, `addLabels`, `removeLabels`, `changeState`, `postComment`, `postReview`,
  `replyToDiffComment`, `resolveDiffThread`, `mergeMergeRequest`, `push`. `BaseAction` carries
  `projectPath` instead of `owner`/`repo`. `EntityKind = "issue" | "mergeRequest"`; mutations on
  MRs go to the MR endpoints (GitHub routes them through issue endpoints — a simplification, not
  a complication).
- **Apply**: `createIssue` → `POST` with pre-resolved `assignee_ids`; `createMergeRequest` →
  `POST` with `labels` and pre-resolved `assignee_ids` likewise (title prefixed `Draft: ` when
  `draft` and not already prefixed), a `409` surfaced
  verbatim (the generic REST meaning is "a conflicting resource already exists" — an MR for these
  branches), the GitHub "approve the push first" guard kept for a `400`/`409` when the source
  branch has a queued push; `changeState` → `PUT {state_event}`; `addLabels`/`removeLabels` →
  `PUT {add_labels}` / `{remove_labels}` — atomic deltas, so a label a human added meanwhile is
  never clobbered; `previousLabels` is captured for revert; `postComment` → `POST …/notes`,
  revert info `{type: "note", kind, noteId}`;
  `postReview` → the live head checked against `revision.headSha`, then `approve {sha:
  revision.headSha}` first for `"approve"` (the one step with a compare-and-swap and the one
  whose failure is expected — a 409 for a moved head — so it runs before anything is posted),
  then N `POST …/draft_notes`, then for `"requestChanges"` `bulk_publish {reviewer_state:
  requested_changes}` — refused while the unpaginated `GET …/draft_notes` shows drafts of the
  user's own, checked before the drafts are created and again just before publishing — and for
  the other two a `PUT …/draft_notes/:id/publish` per draft; the summary goes last, as a plain
  note (locked decision). Every step records itself on the action record (`ReviewProgress`: the
  approval's provenance, each comment's draft, the bulk publish, the summary), and a step GitLab
  could carry out without its answer arriving is recorded as under way first (`"approving"`,
  `"creating"`): a retry asks GitLab what became of it — the approvals read, a held draft with the
  same body and anchor — before repeating it, so a lost answer neither duplicates a comment nor
  strands a draft that a later `requestChanges` would take for the user's. The summary alone is
  posted again after a lost answer: no search can tell its lost post from an earlier note in the
  same words, and taking one for the other would leave the summary silently unposted.
  A discard takes back what the review left unpublished: its parked
  drafts, and its own approval — the one GitLab still dates (`approved_at`) as the review's,
  never one the account held before or has given again since. No `(target, body)`
  matching of provisional diff-comment ids to real notes: the session refuses replies to
  provisional ids, so the aliases would have no reader (GitHub's come free with the review
  POST's response; here they would cost a round-trip); `replyToDiffComment` → resolve note id →
  discussion id (`discussions` lookup) → `POST …/discussions/:id/notes`; `resolveDiffThread` → `PUT …/discussions/:id {resolved: true}`;
  `mergeMergeRequest` → `PUT …/merge` with `sha` bound at prepare (see Locked), mapping the
  documented codes — `405` "cannot merge" (also GitLab's answer once the merge request is
  merged, as it is to the retry of a merge whose reply was lost, so the re-read takes a merge
  request merged at the bound `sha` as that merge and succeeds; otherwise it quotes
  `detailed_merge_status`: `conflict`, `not_approved`, `discussions_not_resolved`,
  `draft_status`, `need_rebase`, … — and, since CI is not exposed in v1,
  `ci_must_pass`/`ci_still_running` say "the pipeline has not passed yet; pipeline status is not
  available through this connection — check it in GitLab"), `409` "the head moved since you read
  it" (`sha` mismatch) — or, when the bound `sha` is the head a queued push to the source branch
  will leave, "approve that push first", the same ordering guard as the create's —, `422` "the
  branch cannot be merged", `401` "no permission to merge";
  `push` → §7. Every branch ends `#markActionApproved` + `#clearCaches()`. An action already
  recorded as applied reports success — the overseer records completion only after the reply, so
  a lost one re-delivers the apply (GitHub does this for `push` alone) — and one a reject cascade
  retired explains that it, or something it depended on, was discarded.
- **Revert**: `setTitle`/`setBody`/`changeState` → `PUT` with the previous value;
  `addLabels` → `PUT {remove_labels}` of only the labels the action *introduced* (those not in
  `previousLabels`), `removeLabels` → `PUT {add_labels}` of only those it *removed* (those in
  `previousLabels`) — the naive inverse would strip a label that was already there; `postComment` /
  `replyToDiffComment` → `DELETE …/notes/:id`; `resolveDiffThread` → `PUT …?resolved=` back to
  `previouslyResolved`, the thread's state as the caller saw it at prepare (queued resolutions
  included, as `previousTitle` is read), and nothing when that already was the requested state —
  so reverting the resolve of an already-resolved thread leaves it resolved; `push` → ref
  rollback (§7); `createIssue`, `createMergeRequest`, `postReview`, `mergeMergeRequest` → "cannot
  be automatically reverted". (An approval *can* be undone with `POST …/unapprove`, but a
  review's published notes cannot, so `postReview` stays non-revertible as a unit.) All of it is
  latent: no Workshop code calls `revertAction`, the descriptions' `implementsRevert: true`
  notwithstanding, so these paths are unreachable here as in GitHub and kept for parity; the
  defects they share with GitHub's are follow-ups for both (Punted).
- **Reject cascades**: as GitHub's (`#rejectActionsForResource`, `#rejectReplyDependencyChain`,
  `#rejectMergeRequestsForMissingBranches`), with three additions. An action *depends* on a
  provisional resource if it targets it **or its text names it** (`#~N` / `!~N`, whole tokens).
  The text fields are the ones `#postedText` rewrites at apply, listed once in
  `referenceBearingTexts` (`gitlab-action-types.ts`) so the rewrite and the cascade cannot drift
  — a reference that apply would fail to rewrite (`requireAll`) is exactly a dependency the
  cascade must retire, or the action stays pending and fails every apply. The cascade recurses:
  a retired *create* means its own provisional never exists, so `#retireProvisional` (the one
  function behind a rejected create, a doomed merge request in the missing-branch cascade, and
  every nested step) retires that provisional's dependents in turn. And a rejected push retires
  what was stacked on it (`#rejectActionsStrandedByPush`, run to a fixpoint before the
  missing-branch check): the head it would have left is stranded unless another queued push to
  the branch leaves it too or the branch is already there (one live read; unread, it counts as
  elsewhere); a push bound to a stranded head could only fail its
  compare-and-swap, blaming the branch for moving, and strands its own new head in turn; a merge
  bound to one could only be refused (`MergeMergeRequestAction.sourceBranch`, recorded at prepare
  for a source branch in this project, names the branch its head is on). Only a rejection
  strands a head; a branch moved by anyone else is the compare-and-swap's to report. GitHub
  cascades on the target alone and not through stacked pushes (Punted). The
  Workshop resolves only the root of a cascade (the overseer drops `rejectAction`'s `restart`),
  so a retired record's card stays pending until the user discards it: `rejectAction` answers a
  record already rejected with success, and `applyAction` says why it cannot run (above).
- **Overlay** (`#overlayIssueLike`): identical, plus `mergeMergeRequest` sets
  `state: "merged"` (GitHub: `state: "closed", merged: true`), `changeState` to `reopened` from
  `merged` is refused at prepare time (GitLab won't reopen a merged MR), and `setTitle` recomputes
  `draft` from the new title, since GitLab derives draft status from the title alone. For the
  same reason a provisional merge request's `draft` is read from the title it will be created
  with (`mergeRequestCreateTitle`, the one function both simulation and apply use), not echoed
  from the `draft` flag: `{ draft: false, title: "Draft: x" }` is a draft.
- **Compare**: `#compareCached` is the one reader of `GET …/repository/compare`, and it refuses a
  response with `compare_timeout: true` rather than serving it — GitLab documents that `diffs`
  may then be incomplete, with nothing in them to say which files are missing, so a reviewer
  shown them would approve a change they had not seen. Not cached, since the next attempt may
  complete; the provisional-details path already degrades `changedFiles` to unknown under its
  own `try/warn`.
- **Merge request diff**: `GET …/merge_requests/:iid/diffs` pages through the files GitLab stored
  for the diff, and a diff over its limits stores only those collected before the limit, with
  nothing in them to say the rest exist. `changes_count` is the diff's `real_size`, `"N+"` exactly
  then, so `#getDiff` refuses on `changedFilesTruncated` rather than serve GitLab's diff, as it
  refuses a timed-out compare; both refusals send the agent to a worktree diff of the head against
  `getMergeBase()`. A diff simulated over queued pushes is computed whole and served.
- **Listing/search**: `#listIssueSummaries` and `#searchIssueSummaries` collapse into one path —
  GitLab's list endpoint *is* the search endpoint (`search=`) — as do the MR pair. The GitHub
  client-side PR scan (`#searchPullSummaries`' buffered upstream walk) is deleted; so is
  `github-search.ts`'s scope-assertion, since a project-scoped endpoint can't leak another
  project's rows. Rows already served as overlaid injected items are dropped by the cursor's
  `filter`, not inside `fetchPage`, so a page is counted as GitLab sent it (the GitHub defect
  under Punted), and each item is served once (`StreamingCursor`'s `identity`, a provisional's
  real id once it has one): a queued create applied while a cursor is drained would otherwise
  list both its injected `~N` and, on a later page, the real row. The injected rows already
  served are re-keyed at every check, since `~N` served before its create landed is the real
  row served after.
  Injected rows re-validate as they are served (`#injectedRowStanding`): a provisional row whose
  create was discarded after the cursor was built is dropped, since opening it would fail. A
  touched row is served as built, its overlay as of that moment: refreshing it could move it in
  the sort order, which a cursor already part-served cannot take back.
  The cursor's `filter` (`issueMatchesFilter`, `mergeRequestMatchesFilter`) runs on GitLab's rows
  too, so it must agree with GitLab's filters or it discards rows GitLab returned: usernames match
  without regard to case, as `User.by_username` looks them up, but label titles exactly, as
  `Issuables::LabelFilter` matches them (`bug` and `Bug` are distinct labels), save its special
  `None` (unlabelled) and `Any` (labelled). The label overlay and its revert match exactly too.
- **Discussion**: `#getDiscussion` reads `…/discussions` for both kinds (locked decision):
  `#fetchRemoteDiscussionComments` flattens the cached discussions, dropping `system` notes and,
  whole, every discussion `diffAnchor` places on the diff; the pull-request two-stream merge
  (comments ⨝ reviews) is gone. `#fetchRemoteDiffThreads` reads the same cached discussions,
  keeps exactly those `diffAnchor` anchors (by the root note's `position`), and maps
  `position` → `GitLabDiffCommentTarget` (`commentTargetFromPosition`, the inverse of
  `#positionFor`): with a `line_range`, *both* ends come from it — `end` → `line`/`side`,
  `start` → `startLine`/`startSide`, each on the side its `type` names — because the top-level
  `old_line`/`new_line` are the line the note was left on, which GitLab does not keep equal to
  the range's end (its own example has a 10–11 range under a top-level 27); without one, the
  top-level pair is the line (`new_line` → `side: "new"`, else `old_line` → `"old"`);
  `position_type === "file"` → file target, and `"image"` too: a point in a picture names no
  line, and inventing one would point the agent at text that is not there.
- **Diff**: `#getDiff` streams `…/diffs` pages through `normalizeDiffFile` (`new_file` →
  `added`, `deleted_file` → `removed`, `renamed_file` → `renamed` with `previousPath: old_path`,
  else `modified`; an empty `diff` — a binary file — or a `too_large` or `collapsed` one →
  `diffOmitted: true`, with `additions`/`deletions` then counting nothing, as the type says);
  additions/deletions per file are counted from the hunks `parsePatch` reads, where a patch's
  final newline ends its last line rather than starting a blank context line an agent could
  comment on. `revision` from `revisionFromDiffRefs(mr.diff_refs)`, and the pages are cached
  under that whole revision (Caches). `#getMergeBaseCached` calls `/repository/merge_base`
  (immutable cache, keyed by both shas) — no compare trick.
- **Caches**: same `Cached<T>`/generation scheme and TTLs; ETags optional and expected absent.
  Cache key families renamed where the entity is (`mr:`, `list-mrs:`, `mr-diffs:`,
  `mr-commits:`). `mr-diffs` pages are keyed by the merge request's whole revision (`baseSha`,
  `mergeBaseSha`, `headSha`), not its head alone, since GitLab recomputes a diff under an
  unchanged head when the target branch moves (GitHub keys on base and head). There is no
  incremental sync state: threads are read whole (locked decision), so GitHub's
  `discussionComments:*` and `pullReviewComments:*` have no counterpart. All documented in
  `storage-schema.md` from the code, not from GitHub's doc.

### 7. Git operations — worktree support

Unchanged in design from plans/worktrees.md §3 and from `GitHubGatekeeperImpl`; the port
substitutes transport endpoints and REST lookups:

- **Advertising**: `GitLabProjectSessionImpl` and `GitLabMergeRequestImpl` own a
  `SessionGitCache`; `listBranches` (`commit.id`), `listTags` (`commit.id`), `resolveRef`,
  `getCommit`, `listCommits`, MR `getDetails` (`sha`, `diff_refs.*`), `readDiff` (revision shas),
  `getMergeBase`, MR `listCommits`, `listMergeRequests`/`searchMergeRequests` (source/target
  shas) all advertise, with the cache-served / simulated carve-out via `isSimulatedCommitId`.
- **`gitPull(oids, cache, hints)`**: `pullGitObjectsIntoCache(body => api.fetchGitUploadPack(
  projectPath, body), oids, hints, cache)`; `fetchGitUploadPack` POSTs to
  `{apiOrigin}/{path}.git/git-upload-pack` with `Git-Protocol: version=2`, Basic `oauth2:<token>`,
  the upstream Access headers, and the 120s budget. The token is fetched immediately before the
  request (it may be minutes from expiry; the pack streams well within the 2-hour window).
- **`push(branch, commitId, {force?})`**: `preparePush` reads the live branch head (`GET
  …/repository/branches/:name`, 404 → `ZERO_OID`), overlays queued pushes via
  `#simulateBranchHead`, no-ops when already at `commitId`, checks `isAncestor` unless `force` or
  creating, queues `{branch, expectedOldSha, newSha, force}` with `pushedCommits: [commitId]`.
  Apply: `cache.buildPack()` → `pushGitRefUpdate(body => api.fetchGitReceivePack(projectPath,
  body), …)`; `GitRefUpdateRejectedError` → re-read head; equal to `newSha` → desired-state
  success, else "branch moved / was created" (GitLab's pre-receive hook text — protected
  branch, push rules — is appended from the `ng` status line so the agent sees *why*). Revert:
  rollback to `expectedOldSha`, or delete when the push created the branch.
- **Simulation**: `#simulateBranchHead`, `#collectPendingChain` (`isCommitOnRemote` via `GET
  …/commits/:sha`, 404 → false), `#simulatedMergeRequestComparison` (`/repository/compare` for the
  anchored part + `diffGitTrees` for the pending chain, merge base from `#simulatedMergeBase`),
  `#treeDiffSource` (`getTree`: cache only, else `null`; `getBlob`: cache, else
  `/repository/blobs/:sha` under `MAX_DIFF_BLOB_BYTES`), `#overlaySimulatedMergeRequestHead`,
  `#overlayMergeRequestSummaryHead`, injected created branches in `listBranches` with
  `revalidateInjected`, `#filterPendingCommitsForListing`. `#servedSimulatedCommitIds` and the
  `MAX_PENDING_CHAIN_COMMITS` cap carry over, and the stored simulated comparison keeps every
  commit the walk withheld, a local merge's side branches included (`pendingCommitIds`), since a
  restarted instance serving it refills the in-memory set from it alone. Two rules keep injected
  rows where GitLab would have listed them: a created branch is injected under a `search` only if
  it satisfies
  `branchNameMatchesSearch`, which applies GitLab's own `GitRefsFinder#by_search` (case-insensitive;
  a plain term anywhere in the name; with `^`, `$` or `*` present, a literal pattern where the
  first `^` anchors the start, the first `$` the end and each `*` is a wildcard — the docs
  mention only the two anchors), and `issuableComparator` orders a `popularity` listing by the
  summary's `upvotes` (carried for that reason) with ties broken by id descending whatever the
  direction, as `Issuable#sort_by_attribute` appends `id DESC` — most rows tie under
  `popularity`, so the tie-break places most of them. A queued commit passes `listCommits`'
  `author` filter as GitLab's does, which is `git log --author` through Gitaly: a case-sensitive
  substring of `Name <email>` (Gitaly adds `--regexp-ignore-case` only to message searches), exact
  for any text without regex characters. A full commit id GitLab does not know is
  read from the cache only when the simulation stands behind it (`#readQueuedPushCommit`: a
  commit it has served, or one a queued push's chain reaches). The overseer already answers
  this gatekeeper only for its project's objects and its own queued pushes; the check keeps the
  simulation, not the cache's contents, the authority on which commits read as pushed. Two gaps
  are known, both shared with GitHub (Punted): the pending chain follows first parents, while
  GitLab's commit listing follows every parent, so a queued merge's side branch is missing from
  `listCommits()` until its push lands (advertising is unaffected: `#recordPendingSideParents`
  withholds the side parents too); and a queued push to a merge request's *target* branch is
  not overlaid onto its comparison, which changes the reviewed diff only when that push moves
  the merge base. The merge base is not the anchor's, though: a queued merge of the target into
  the source (parents `[source, target]`) contains the target head, so GitLab will diff against
  that head, where `merge-base(target, anchor)` is the older fork point and would put the
  target's own changes in the reviewed diff. `#collectPendingChain` returns the *frontier* --
  every commit GitLab has where the pending ancestry ends, side parents' included -- and
  `#simulatedMergeBase` asks one `/merge_base` with the target and the whole frontier: given more
  than two commits, `git merge-base` answers for the first and a hypothetical merge of the rest,
  whose candidates are exactly the queued head's, so an unrelated frontier commit adds nothing and
  a criss-cross tie is broken as it will be for the pushed head.
- **Fork MRs**: a source branch in another project (`source_project_id !== target_project_id`)
  is never overlaid (GitHub checks `head.repo.fullName !== this.#repoFullName()`; here
  `source.project.path !== projectPath`), and a push targets only the bound project.

### 8. Observers

Strategy B, as GitHub: `GitLabVerifierApi extends GatekeeperUserVerifier { hasProjectAccess(
projectPath): Promise<boolean> }`; `GitLabVerifier` probes the observer's membership with their
own token (below); `addObserver` throws when it returns `false`; `removeObserver` is a no-op.
Issue and MR bindings inherit the project ACL. The internal stub's strategy-C tracker is not
carried over (no group scope, §Locked).

Two tightenings over GitHub's "a 200 means read access", both grounded in GitLab's documentation
and both places where GitHub's model, carried over unexamined, would leak:

- **Repository read is not implied by seeing the project.** GitLab's **Guest** role can "view and
  comment on issues" on a private project but "cannot push code or access repository". A 200 on
  the project alone would admit an observer to cached git data they cannot read on GitLab.
- **Project visibility is not implied to cover everything in it.** "You can create confidential
  issues in a public project"; a confidential issue is visible only to Planner+ (Reporter+ before
  17.7), and an *internal note* — on an issue, epic, or merge request, public project or not — is
  visible only to Reporter+. A non-member on a public project would be admitted to confidential
  issues and internal notes the owner's token read. GitHub has no counterpart: a public repo's
  issues and comments are all public, which is why its probe can stop at "can read the repo".

So the probe requires **membership at Reporter (20) or above**, whatever the visibility: the
documented ladder is 5 Minimal, 10 Guest, 15 Planner, 20 Reporter, 25 Security Manager, 30
Developer, 40 Maintainer, 50 Owner, and Reporter is the lowest role that sees everything a binding
can disclose. It reads that from the observer's **effective membership** — `GET /user` for their
id, then `GET /projects/P/members/all?user_ids[]=:id`, documented as "including members inherited
or invited through ancestor groups" and returning "only their membership with the highest
`access_level` … the effective permission of the user" — never from the project's `permissions`
object. The list form with the documented `user_ids` filter, rather than `members/all/:user_id`:
its non-member answer is a documented shape (`[]`) that was verified live, where the single-member
form's 404 is neither documented nor reachable through the tooling used to check. A spot check on the internal instance (as one user, five `cloudflare/…` group projects in
three subgroups) is why: `permissions` read `project_access: 50` on the one project with a
*direct* membership and `null`/`null` on the other four, where `members/all` showed the same user
as an inherited Developer. On that project ~90% of members (75 of 86) hold their access by
inheritance, so a `permissions`-based probe would have denied nearly every legitimate observer
once the visibility branch was gone — and before that had admitted them for the wrong reason. The
same check confirmed the probe's inputs: a genuine non-member (a user-namespace project) reads
`[]`, the inherited Developer one row at 30, a nonexistent id `[]`. A
membership still `awaiting` acceptance is not one, nor is one whose `expires_at` has arrived (the
locked decision above); 404 (non-member, or a project the token cannot see) and 403 → `false`;
anything else rethrows.

Over-strictness is accepted where the ladder is finer than our threshold: Planner (15) sees
confidential issues and gains private-repository read in 18.7+, and a per-role custom permission
could too — both are denied here, which under `excludeObservers` semantics blocks an observation
rather than leaking one. So is the non-member collaborator on a public open-source project: they
can observe once the owner grants them Reporter, and until then a workspace that never read a
confidential issue still denies them. That trade is the right way round — the alternative,
stripping confidential issues and internal notes from what the gatekeeper discloses so that the
public-project admission becomes sound, would take a headline GitLab feature (security triage in
confidential issues) away from every owner to serve the rarer case.

### 9. Tests

Same two-project layout as GitHub (`vitest.config.ts` node, `vitest.worker.config.ts` workerd
with `capnwebValidate()`, `assert-workerd.ts`, a `TestHooks` DO reaching the gatekeeper through
`ctx.facets`). As built — the per-commit list under Commit sequence names each file's scenarios:

- Node: `gitlab-api.test.ts` — path encoding for nested namespaces and branch names with
  slashes; every endpoint's query composition; the two redirect messages, by path, and the OAuth
  and git posts' refusal of a redirect; the error-body shapes, read under the cap; `x-next-page`
  paging, and the draft listing read in one request; OAuth bodies, PKCE, `invalid_grant`
  classification; Access headers present iff both secrets set; `oauth2` basic-auth username on
  both git POSTs; the capped raw blob read; the members filter and highest-row fold; the
  `reviewer_state` version gate. `gitlab-normalize.test.ts` — REST→API mapping,
  `revisionFromDiffRefs`, `parseResourceUrl` round trips including `/-/` splitting, the
  line-position walk with each line's kind.
  `configurator-url.test.ts` — each configurator's `resourceUrl` round-trips through
  `parseResourceUrl`, and every pre-fill parser agrees with it.
- Workerd, GitLab faked at `fetch`: `account.test.ts` (refresh rotation and collapse, terminal vs
  transient failure, a dead grant not refreshed again, a 401 for a token a refresh had already
  replaced ignored, the expiry latch, a reconnect overtaken by a newer one revoked rather than
  committed,
  a stub-era grant still served, `ensureResources` answering an under-scoped grant with the
  reconnect URL, a disconnect racing the code exchange, identity), `resources.test.ts` (pattern
  order incl. tab suffixes, URL parsing, stale props, the membership probe: Reporter admitted
  however held, Guest/Planner/non-member/awaiting/expired denied, `permissions` never consulted),
  `reads.test.ts` (every read's shape, the Access headers on every request, the `diff_refs`
  inversion, a diff re-read when the target moves under the same head, approvals left out when
  unreadable, confidential issues and internal notes, a short page mid-listing, MR commit order,
  discussion filtering, threads and their replies), `actions.test.ts` (provisional
  create/read/apply/resolve, a created issue served once by a listing opened before its create
  applied, reject cascades by target, by whole-token reference and through a dependent create,
  the retired cards then discarding cleanly, each mutation's simulation/apply/revert including
  label-revert deltas and a resolve's revert, the review publish path in all three shapes and
  every line kind's position, a retry that repeats no step whose reply was lost, the user's own
  drafts left alone and `requestChanges` refused while they exist, the discard paths, empty
  reviews refused, an
  already-applied action re-delivered, a touched issue on a full listing page, the merge head
  bound, a merge already landed at it, and the error mapping), `push.test.ts` (CAS binding,
  stacking, no-op, non-ff refusal, branch creation, simulated heads in every read, a full commit
  id served only when a queued push reaches it, the pending chain in listings, the simulated MR
  comparison and its degradation, apply/desired-state/revert with a binary pack, cascades to
  dependent MRs and through stacked pushes and merges, the v2 fetch), `session-git.test.ts`
  (page sizes, every commit-id-bearing read advertising — `searchMergeRequests` and the merge
  base included — simulated ids withheld, and no observation recorded by mutations, by opening a
  stub, or by the reads that bind a push or a merge).
- Kit: the moved node tests, unchanged apart from import paths and the neutral type names, and
  `advertisePages`/`PageHookCursor`: an id counts as advertised only once its advertisement has
  landed, and a page whose hook threw is offered again.

### 10. Deployment integration (public repo)

- `cloudflare.config.ts`, from which the committed `wrangler.jsonc` is generated: name
  `gatekeeper-gitlab`, the `capnweb-validate` output as entrypoint, compatibility flags as
  GitHub's, the default gatekeeper Text rules for `.txt`/`.svg`, `migrations: [{tag: "v0",
  new_sqlite_classes: ["UserAccount", "GitLabGatekeeperImpl"]}]`, observability block. No `vars`
  block (defaults live in code so an absent var means gitlab.com).
- `deploy-inputs.json`: `CLIENT_ID` (`consoleUrl: https://gitlab.com/-/user_settings/applications`,
  with `help` saying that the link opens gitlab.com and that a self-managed deployment creates
  the application on its own instance — the wizard cannot know `GITLAB_URL`, which is set after
  deploy; setup steps naming the redirect URI, the `api`, `write_repository` and `read_user`
  scopes, and "Confidential" checked), `CLIENT_SECRET`.
  `redirectUriTemplate: "{PUBLIC_BASE_URL}/gatekeeper/gitlab/oauth"`.
- `README.md`: modeled on GitHub's — OAuth app creation on gitlab.com, `.env`, optional
  sign-in via `AUTH_GATEKEEPERS=…,gitlab`, a **Self-hosted instances** section (`GITLAB_URL`,
  `GITLAB_API_URL`, the Access service-token pair, the note that the OAuth app on the instance
  must allow the redirect URI and scopes), troubleshooting (`invalid_grant` after long idle =
  refresh token expired → reconnect; `redirect_uri` mismatch; "not configured").
- `run-dev-server.ts:SHARED_GATEKEEPER_CREDS` gains `"gatekeeper-gitlab": { id: "GITLAB_CLIENT_ID",
  secret: "GITLAB_CLIENT_SECRET" }`. `scripts/release/testdata/fixture-bundles/gatekeeper-gitlab/
  gitlab.js` + `UPDATE_GOLDEN=1` regen. `staging-config.test.ts`'s `>= 16` floor is unaffected.
- `packages/gatekeeper-gitlab/vite.config.ts` re-exports the shared configurator config wrapped
  with `withVitestTask(..., ["vitest run", "vitest run -c vitest.worker.config.ts"])`, exactly as
  GitHub's.
- Repo docs: AGENTS.md's package list gains a short `gatekeeper-gitlab` bullet pointing at this
  plan's divergence table and the README's instance configuration, the detail staying with the
  code it describes; the write-gatekeeper skill's reference list gains it as "GitHub mirror with
  rotating credentials and instance configuration".

### 11. What the internal deployment needs from this package

Kept abstract here; the concrete hostnames, Vault paths, and job definitions are in the internal
repo's companion plan. The public package must, and does, provide: a worker named
`gatekeeper-gitlab` with DO classes `UserAccount` and `GitLabGatekeeperImpl` under tag `v0`
(in-place upgrade of the stub's worker); `vars` `GITLAB_URL` / `GITLAB_API_URL` settable per
deployment; secrets `CLIENT_ID` / `CLIENT_SECRET` / `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_ID` / `CF_ACCESS_CLIENT_SECRET`;
the `/gatekeeper/gitlab/oauth` callback path; and fail-closed handling of the stub's leftover
`read_api` grants and `{scopePath}` props. The internal PR bumps the submodule past this one
(its first bump past the kit's introduction), deletes its stub, adds the `PACKAGE_OVERRIDES`
entry and a dedicated deploy-then-`secret put` job, and updates the OAuth app's redirect URI and
scopes.

## Constants (tunable, named in one place)

- `ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY_SAFETY_MS` — refresh when less than this remains (60 s; GitLab tokens live
  7200 s).
- `ENTITY_CACHE_TTL_MS` / `LIST_CACHE_TTL_MS` / `IMMUTABLE_CACHE_TTL_MS` / `VIEWER_CACHE_TTL_MS`,
  `DISCUSSION_SYNC_OVERLAP_MS`, `DISCUSSION_SYNC_BAIL_LIMIT`, `MAX_REPLY_TARGET_HOPS`,
  `MAX_PENDING_CHAIN_COMMITS` — GitHub's values.
- `REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` (30 s), `GIT_TIMEOUT_MS` (120 s) — GitHub's values.
- `DEFAULT_INSTANCE_URL = "https://gitlab.com"`.

## Verification

No pre-implementation spikes. Every API-shape question was answered from the current GitLab
documentation (a full pass over the OAuth2/OIDC, Users, Projects, Issues, Notes, Discussions,
Draft Notes, Merge Requests, Approvals, Repositories, Commits, Branches, Tags, REST-pagination and
roles pages), and the remaining unknowns are either deployment facts no token could answer or
questions whose answers matter only to punted work. Confidence is built in layers instead:

1. **Doc-derived fixtures.** The workerd suites fake GitLab at `fetch` with the documentation's
   own example responses (§2's table cites where each came from), labelled `source: docs` in the
   fixture files. At each live checkpoint below they are replaced by captured responses and the
   label flips to `source: live`; a fixture still labelled `docs` after checkpoint 2 is a review
   finding.
2. **Live checkpoint 1 — read-only, after commit 4**, against a throwaway gitlab.com project
   with a personal `api`-scoped token standing in for the OAuth grant: every observation method
   end to end, plus the documented ambiguities that only a live call settles — does `GET /user`
   under a `read_user`-scoped token include the private `email` (decides the sign-in scope,
   §Locked); is an abbreviated sha accepted by `GET …/commits/:sha` (the docs imply it via their
   `merge_base` example); how a binary file appears in `…/diffs` (undocumented — assume empty
   `diff`); `with_labels_details` and `permissions` shapes as documented.
3. **Live checkpoint 2 — actions and git, after commit 6**: the OAuth flow itself against a
   registered gitlab.com application (PKCE + `client_secret`, refresh rotation, revoke);
   push/fetch through our own smart-HTTP framing with an OAuth token holding `api
   write_repository`; draft notes → `bulk_publish` with `reviewer_state`; `approve` with a stale
   `sha` (409); `position_type: file`; the exact pre-receive text on a protected-branch push
   (only ever passed through, never matched); a moved project's 301.
4. **Staging soak (internal plan)**: the deployment facts — the Access service token on the
   `.git/` paths of the service-token hostname, our User-Agent against the WAF, the instance
   version against the gates below, and the stub-era reconnect path.

**Documentation findings that changed the design** (each is now a locked decision or table cell
above): Git-over-HTTPS for OAuth tokens is documented for `read_repository`/`write_repository`
only, so connections request `api write_repository`; OIDC `email` claims need a *public* email,
so identity comes from `GET /user`; `bulk_publish` carries `reviewer_state: requested_changes`,
so `requestChanges` is in v1; renamed projects answer `301` to a numeric-id URL, so
`redirect: "manual"`; `changes_count` caps at `"1000+"`; `/merge` has no documented 406; the
project issues endpoint has no `in` param; the token response has no `scope` field, so requested
scopes are recorded; `x-total` is unreliable, so `x-next-page` is the exhaustion signal (a short
page is not: filtered listings return them mid-walk); `diff_refs.base_sha` is confirmed to be the
merge base and `start_sha` the target head. GitLab's source then settled what the docs leave
open: the draft-note listing is not paginated, `reviewer_state` arrived in 19.2 (earlier versions
ignore it without an error), and `GET /user` under `read_user` presents the private `email` (still
to be seen live; §Locked).

**Version gates to check against the target instance** (the internal instance — version to be
read from its `/help` page; gitlab.com is always current): `draft` list filter 19.0 (we use `wip`, works
everywhere); `reviewer_state` on `bulk_publish` 19.2 (the gatekeeper reads the Metadata API's
`version` and refuses `requestChanges` below it); `collapsed`/`too_large` on `/diffs` 18.4 (both
optional in our reader); "requested changes blocks merge" 17.2 Premium/Ultimate (state is set
regardless); `auto_merge` 17.11 (CI follow-up); `order_by=merged_at` 17.2 (not used); Planner
role 17.7 and its private-repo read 18.7 (probe denies it either way). Everything else we use
predates the docs' history window and needs no check.

**Dropped as irrelevant to v1**: Gitaly's acceptance of `tree:<depth≥1>`/`combine:` filter specs
(our transport sends only the universally valid `blob:none`/`blob:limit`/`tree:0`; GitLab
documents partial clone, which implies `uploadpack.allowFilter`, and the docs list
`uploadpack.allowAnySHA1InWant` among Gitaly-set values, so blob wants by sha work as partial
clone requires — tree-by-oid pull-through is therefore *feasible* on GitLab, and stays punted for
scope, not feasibility).

## Known edge cases / watch-fors

- **`diff_refs` inversion.** GitLab's `base_sha` is the merge base and `start_sha` the target
  head; our `baseSha` is the target head. One helper, one test, and a comment at every use site
  that says which is which. Getting this wrong makes `getMergeBase()` return the wrong commit
  and every worktree review diff against the wrong parent — silently.
- **Refresh-token rotation under concurrency.** Two callers racing a refresh must not each
  redeem the same refresh token: the second redemption fails (`invalid_grant`) and, worse, GitLab
  may revoke the family. The mutex plus in-lock re-read is what prevents it; the workerd test
  drives N concurrent `getAccessToken()` calls against a fake token endpoint that counts
  redemptions and asserts exactly one.
- **Expired-while-idle accounts.** A refresh token unused for long enough (instance-configured;
  gitlab.com's default is generous) dies with `invalid_grant`. That is the normal
  `credentialsExpired()` → reconnect path, but the first symptom is an agent read failing days
  after the last one succeeded; the error text should say "reconnect", not "401".
- **Stale stub state after the internal cutover.** `read_api` grants and `{scopePath}` props
  (locked decision). Both paths are tested: a stub-era grant still serves `describe()` and
  answers `ensureResources()` with the reconnect URL; stale props throw the reconnect message
  and nothing else.
- **`:project+` over-matching.** The project pattern matches issue and MR URLs; only the
  resource ordering keeps the modal pre-selecting the right one. The ordering test guards it, and
  `getGatekeeperClassFor` never trusts the pattern.
- **Project renames and transfers.** `projectPath` in props goes stale when a project moves,
  and the API answers the old path with a documented `301` whose `Location` is the numeric-id
  URL (see the redirects locked decision for why that must never be followed). The binding then
  fails with "project moved — re-bind", the same exposure GitHub has with `owner/repo`. Not
  solved here; noted so nobody reaches for the numeric id in a hurry — that would break the
  observer probe's path-based ACL check and every URL builder.
- **`line_code` for multi-line diff comments is computed, not fetched.** GitLab's documented
  form is `<SHA1 of the file path>_<old_line>_<new_line>`; each `line_range` endpoint also needs
  `type: "new" | "old"`. The DO derives it with `crypto.subtle.digest("SHA-1", path)` from the
  target's `startLine`/`line` and `side`; a node test pins the derivation against the docs'
  example (`588440f66559714280628a4f9799f0c4eb880a4a_10_10` for `package.json`).
- **The documented token response has no `scope`.** So granted scopes cannot be read back from
  the exchange; `UserAccount` records the scopes it *requested*, and the stale-stub guard keys on
  that record's absence. If a deployer's OAuth application is registered with fewer scopes than
  requested, GitLab rejects the authorize request outright rather than silently narrowing, so the
  record is trustworthy.
- **`GET /user` under `read_user` and the private `email`.** The scope is documented as exposing
  the "public email", but GitLab's source presents the token's own user with `email` and
  `confirmed_at` whatever that setting (locked decision). Live checkpoint 1 confirms it; the
  fallback is `read_api` for the transient sign-in grant. Either way the check is `email` +
  non-null `confirmed_at`, never `public_email` (which the user chose to publish, not the provider
  verified).
- **Branch names with slashes** in `GET …/repository/branches/:name` must be encoded per
  segment-as-a-whole (`encodeURIComponent` of the full name, slashes included) — GitLab expects
  `feature%2Fx`, the opposite of GitHub's per-segment join. Test pins it.
- **Long threads read whole.** `readDiscussion()` fetches every discussion page (100 per page)
  before answering, since the endpoint cannot be walked incrementally (locked decision). A
  thousand-comment issue is ten pages per uncached read. Revisit with a bounded window if it
  shows up.
- **`with_labels_details` doubles payload size** on list endpoints. Acceptable at
  `per_page=100`; if list latency becomes a problem, fetch details lazily on `getDetails()` only.
- **Draft notes are per-user drafts on the MR.** `bulk_publish` is documented as publishing
  "all pending draft notes for a merge request that belong to the user" — including drafts the
  human left in the web UI. So only `requestChanges`, which needs the reviewer state that
  `bulk_publish` alone records, calls it, and it refuses while `GET …/draft_notes` shows a draft
  of the user's own — read before its drafts are created and again just before publishing; the
  round trip between that read and the publish is the window GitLab's API leaves, accepted as
  rare. `comment` and `approve` publish their drafts one by one (`PUT …/draft_notes/:id/publish`)
  and never touch the user's (locked decision). The listing is not paginated — GitLab's handler
  presents `load_draft_notes` without `paginate` and ignores page parameters — so it is read in
  one request: walked as pages, it would answer the same full list for every page and, at 100
  drafts, never end.
- **Access service token on the git endpoints.** If the Access application in front of the
  instance covers only `/api/v4`, git fetch/push will 302 to a login page, and the pkt-line
  parser would fail on HTML. Both git POSTs refuse the redirect (naming Access and its service
  token, as every request does) and check `Content-Type` before streaming, so a login page or
  proxy answering with a 200 is reported as such rather than as a parse error.
- **`Draft:` prefix collisions.** GitLab documents three recognised prefixes — `Draft:`,
  `[Draft]`, `(Draft)` — and recognises no others: legacy `WIP:` is gone from the docs and from
  `Gitlab::Regex.merge_request_draft` (`\A(?i)(\[draft\]|\(draft\)|draft:)`), which
  `hasDraftPrefix` mirrors. Creating with `draft: true` when
  the title already carries one must not double-prefix; setting a title later that drops the
  prefix un-drafts the MR (documented: "Remove `[Draft]`, `Draft:` or `(Draft)` from the
  beginning of the title") — noted on `setTitle`.
- **Rate limits.** gitlab.com documents 2,000 authenticated API requests/min per user and 400/min
  on `GET /projects/:id`; self-managed limits are off by default and admin-set. The cache and the
  cursors' page sizes keep us far below. A 429 carries `Retry-After` (and `RateLimit-*` headers);
  it is surfaced as-is with the wait in the message. Note the documented 429 for rate-limited
  `search` queries on the MR list.
- **Asynchronous fields after create.** `diff_refs` and `changes_count` are documented as empty
  right after an MR is created and "populate asynchronously". A `readDiff()` or `getMergeBase()`
  immediately after `createMergeRequest` is applied may see them empty; the DO retries the single
  GET once after a short delay before falling back to `/merge_base` + `sha` (which are always
  available) to build the revision itself.

## Commit sequence

Two PRs. Within the public PR, commits are ordered so the kit refactor is reviewable apart from
the new package and the new package's API is reviewable before its implementation (AGENTS.md's
kernel bar doesn't apply — no `workshop-backend`/`workshop-shared` lines change — but the same
"small reviewable units" discipline does). Each commit keeps the packages it modifies green.

**PR A — public repo**

1. **plan** — this document.
2. **kit: move the git layer out of gatekeeper-github** — `git-transport`, `git-objects`,
   `git-diff` with their node tests, README inventory rows, `diff` dependency; github imports
   them, its `git-commits.ts` shrinks to the REST adapters plus a wrapper over the kit's
   `commitDetailsFromGitObject`, and its per-page commit advertising becomes a hook
   (`advertisePages`) on the kit's generic `PageHookCursor` rather than a cursor class each
   gatekeeper would wrap for RPC. One commit rather than add-then-switch so git's rename detection
   holds and the reviewable diff is the comment edits and the split, not a 600-line addition
   followed by a 600-line deletion. `types.d.ts` is untouched: its `GitHubPullRequestDiff*` types
   are structurally identical to the kit's `GitDiff*`, and the agent-facing text must stay
   self-contained. Behavior-neutral apart from two failure-path fixes (a failed advertisement no
   longer suppresses its ids or loses its page; `parseGitIdentity`'s polynomial-time pattern);
   github's suites, unchanged apart from import paths, are the proof.
3. **gitlab: package skeleton + API design** — `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`,
   the node vitest config, `cloudflare.config.ts` (and the `wrangler.jsonc` generated from it),
   `deploy-inputs.json`, logo, `text-modules.d.ts`, `observability.ts`, **`types.d.ts` +
   `types.txt`** (the review artifact, §5), `README.md`, `storage-schema.md` skeleton,
   `gitlab-api.ts` with its node tests (§2, incl. OAuth helpers, PKCE, Access headers, git POST
   framing, redirect refusal), the documentation-derived fixtures (Verification, layer 1), and the
   release-manifest fixture bundle + golden. Nothing yet implements `Gatekeeper`. **Review
   checkpoint: `types.d.ts` was approved before commit 4.**
4. **gitlab: accounts, resources, configurators, and every read** — the file layout diverges
   from github's single `github.ts` for reviewability: `gitlab.ts` (entrypoint, vendor,
   `UserAccount` with PKCE and refresh under a mutex, `GatekeeperUserImpl`, `GitLabVerifier`),
   `gitlab-env.ts` (instance configuration and resource patterns), `gitlab-normalize.ts` (pure
   REST→API mapping, `revisionFromDiffRefs`, `parsePatch`), `gitlab-cursors.ts`,
   `gitlab-action-types.ts`, `gitlab-gatekeeper.ts` (the DO), `gitlab-sessions.ts`, and the
   three configurators. Every observation method with caches and overlays; the action methods
   throw "not available". Node: `gitlab-normalize.test.ts`, `gitlab-env.test.ts`,
   `configurator-url.test.ts`. Workerd (its vitest config lands here): the `TestHooks` harness
   with undecorated `TestUser`/`TestVerifier` subclasses against a GitLab faked at `fetch`,
   `account.test.ts` (refresh rotation and collapse, terminal vs transient failure, the
   under-scoped-grant remedy via `ensureResources`, identity), `resources.test.ts` (pattern
   order, URL parsing, stale props, the membership probe), `reads.test.ts` (every read's shape,
   the `diff_refs` inversion, MR commit order, discussion filtering, threads).
5. **gitlab: actions and their simulation** — the action records, `submitActionForApproval`,
   provisional ids and `#~N`/`!~N` rewriting, all `prepare*` (assignees resolved to ids; both MR
   branches validated; a merged MR refused a reopen), `applyAction`/`rejectAction`/`revertAction`
   for every non-push action, reject cascades, draft-note reviews (the reviewed head re-checked
   first and `approve` bound to its `sha`; `requestChanges` bulk-published with `reviewer_state`,
   refused while the user has drafts of their own parked there; `comment` and `approve` published
   draft by draft; each step recorded on the action record, so a retry resumes and a discard takes
   back the parked drafts and the review's own approval), positions naming a line by its kind and
   `line_range` line_codes from one hunk walk, thread replies and resolution, merge with GitLab's
   error codes mapped. Workerd: `actions.test.ts` (lifecycle scenarios including the review's
   retry and discard paths).
6. **gitlab: git pull, push, and the simulation of queued pushes** — `gitPull`, `preparePush`/
   apply/revert, `#collectPendingChain`, `#simulatedMergeRequestComparison` (compare + merge_base
   against the anchor, local tree diff; degrades when a tree is not cached), head overlays on MR
   details and summaries, injected created branches, pending-chain injection in `listCommits`,
   the `isSimulatedCommitId` carve-outs, full-id reads of a queued push's commits, and a rejected
   push retiring the pushes and merges stacked on it. Workerd: `push.test.ts` (incl. GitLab's
   pre-receive reason passed through and a binary pack) and `session-git.test.ts` (advertising
   wiring, and no observation recorded by a read that only prepares an action or opens a session).
7. **repo plumbing and docs** — `run-dev-server.ts`'s `SHARED_GATEKEEPER_CREDS` entry and the
   self-hosted instance variables in its `PASSTHROUGH_GATEKEEPER_VARS`, the AGENTS.md bullet, the
   write-gatekeeper skill's reference list, this section brought in line with what landed.
8. **gitlab: OAuth callbacks relayed to Worker Previews** — the kit's `PreviewOAuth` in the
   authorize redirect and the `/oauth` callback (§3: direct in production; on a preview, the
   stable Worker's redirect and a signed state, relayed back), the `redirect_uri` recorded on the
   `oauth`-stage nonce for the exchange, and the README's preview setup. Workerd:
   `oauth-relay.test.ts`.

**PR B — internal repo** (companion plan there has the specifics)

1. **submodule bump** past PR A's merge, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`/lockfile as the bump requires,
   `pnpm --dir public install`, generated configs regenerated.
2. **cutover** — delete `packages/gatekeeper-gitlab`; `PACKAGE_OVERRIDES["gatekeeper-gitlab"]`
   with the two instance vars; replace the two `wrangler-secret` component jobs with a
   `deploy-gatekeeper-gitlab` job (zoominfo pattern) pushing all four secrets from Vault (the
   OAuth pair is new to Vault); `deploy-public` `needs:` updated; staging secrets by hand; OAuth
   app redirect URI + scopes updated on the instance; README/AGENTS/`gatekeeper-shared/README.md`
   stale-flow cleanup; the root `vite.config.ts` lint comment that cites the stub's parked
   scaffolding.

## Punted / future work (deliberately kept open)

- **Diff pages pinned to the revision `readDiff()` returned.** `…/merge_requests/:iid/diffs`
  serves the latest diff version, so a page fetched after the head or target moves belongs to
  the newer comparison, and is cached under the older revision's key. `readDiff()`'s JSDoc says
  so ("later pages may reflect those newer changes"), as GitHub's does. A review prepared from
  such pages is bound to the old head and refused at apply if the head moved; what remains is a
  target that moves alone mid-drain. The pin is `GET …/versions` then `…/versions/:id` (a
  version never changes), but that endpoint returns the whole diff unpaginated, which changes the
  read's memory profile and how a diff over the limits is refused: its own change.
- **Group-scoped bindings** ("all projects under `group/`"): strategy-C observers over
  per-project sets (the kit's `ObserverTracker` is the tool), `listProjects`/`searchProjects` on
  a `GitLabGroup` session, a fourth `urlPattern`. The internal stub's one feature not carried.
- **`unapprove()`** (`POST …/unapprove`, documented; a review's discard already calls it for the
  review's own approval), reviewers on `createMergeRequest` (`reviewer_ids`), and setters for
  assignees, reviewers and milestones on existing issues and merge requests — the next triage
  features review asked for, after `createMergeRequest` gained the labels and assignees
  `createIssue` takes. Each is small; all are omitted for GitHub parity.
- **CI/CD — deliberately excluded from v1, to be added to both gatekeepers by a separate plan.**
  GitHub's gatekeeper has no Actions/checks support, and this port keeps parity rather than
  letting GitLab run ahead. What that costs, so the follow-up is scoped honestly: after
  `push()` → `createMergeRequest()` the agent cannot learn whether the pipeline passed
  (`head_pipeline` is on the MR object we already fetch — the field is dropped, not unavailable),
  cannot read a job log to diagnose a failure, cannot retry/cancel/play jobs, cannot merge with
  "when pipeline succeeds", and `getCommit()` cannot report a commit's status. Review suggested
  the smallest first step — a `getHeadPipeline()` read over `head_pipeline`, with no raw-API
  escape hatch — and `autoMerge` beside it, merging when the pipeline succeeds being GitLab's
  usual flow. The follow-up
  plan covers pipeline/job reads (with a tail-capped log read), the cheap non-revertible actions
  (`retry`/`cancel`/`play`), `autoMerge` on `merge()`, and the GitHub equivalents (check runs,
  workflow runs, job logs, re-run). Documented starting points: `head_pipeline` on the single-MR
  GET (with `status`, `web_url`, `detailed_status`), `last_pipeline` on the single-commit GET,
  `auto_merge` on `/merge` (17.11), and `GET /jobs/:id/trace`, whose size and `Range` behaviour
  the docs don't cover.
- **Honouring both pull hints at once** if Gitaly accepts `combine:` / `tree:<depth≥1>` — the
  docs list only `blob:none`, `blob:limit` and `sparse:oid` for partial clone; a live probe would
  settle it. A GitLab-specific `filterSpecForHints` variant in the kit, selected by the
  gatekeeper.
- **Tree-by-oid pull-through** for the simulated MR diff, if Gitaly permits non-tip tree
  `want`s: the DO's `#treeDiffSource.getTree` would issue a filtered upload-pack for the one
  tree instead of returning `null`.
- **Simulated reads past the side walk's cap.** Local merges whose side branches hold more than
  `MAX_PENDING_CHAIN_COMMITS` unpushed commits (an octopus merge of 251 included) make
  `#recordPendingSideParents` throw, so listings and the comparison fall back to GitLab's state.
  It fails rather than stops part-way because a listed merge names every side parent, and one
  left unmarked would be advertised as GitLab's and left out of the push pack. Lifting it means
  resolving every root whatever the bound and leaving only the merge base's frontier unknown.
- **Numeric project id alongside the path** in props, refreshed on first read, to survive
  renames/transfers — needs an answer for the observer probe and URL builders first.
- **Lazy label details** if `with_labels_details` list payloads prove heavy.
- **`autoMerge`** (`merge_when_pipeline_succeeds` / `auto_merge`) on `merge()`; `rebase()` on
  the MR session (`PUT …/rebase`, async — needs polling).
- **Reactions / emoji awards, milestones, iterations, epics, time tracking, work items** — GitLab
  has a lot of surface neither gatekeeper touches.
- **Inbound Access-JWT verification** as an opt-in for deployments that want defence in depth
  at the worker (would want a kit module shared with the internal repo's `access-jwt.ts`).
- **A shared `GitHubApi`/`GitLabApi` HTTP-client base in the kit** — the `request()`/
  `conditionalGet()`/error-class trio is now duplicated twice; a third copy is when it earns a
  module.
- **The kit's `OAuthClient` for both git gatekeepers' token requests.** Review asked for the
  kit's production-tested client in place of `gitlab-api.ts`'s hand-written exchange, refresh
  and revoke (GitHub hand-writes its exchange too). Deferred, because today it would cost two
  things this port does: it refuses any endpoint that is not `https`, where this port accepts
  loopback `http` for a GitLab run on the developer's machine; and its 3xx refusal drops the
  `Location`, so it cannot say that Access, not GitLab, answered. Each is a small kit change, and
  the client is independent of the coordinator (gatekeeper-cloudflare and mcp-shared use
  `OAuthClient` without it), so moving both gatekeepers to it is a change of its own.
- **Replies to provisional diff comments, in both gatekeepers.** Each session's
  `replyToDiffComment()` refuses a `~` id up front, so the machinery behind it — the
  `diffAlias:` keys written at apply, the hop-bounded chain walk in the reply resolver, and the
  reject cascade over reply chains — is unreachable in GitHub and GitLab alike. GitLab does not
  write the aliases for review comments (GitHub's come free with the review POST's response;
  here they would cost a discussions round-trip and a signature match), but otherwise mirrors
  the dead paths for parity. Either lift the gate in both, making a reply to a not-yet-published
  review comment queue behind its parent, or delete the paths in both.
- **Agent-facing text about pending creation, in both gatekeepers.** Review noted that
  gatekeepers generally do not tell the agent a mutation may be provisional — a gatekeeper does
  not present itself as running inside a simulation — where this port, like GitHub's, says
  "While creation is pending, the returned issue will have a provisional ID". What the agent
  needs is that an id may read `~N` and that `#~N`/`!~N` resolve, not why. `types.d.ts` keeps
  GitHub's wording so the two read alike; trimming it is one change to both.
- **Gaps both gatekeepers keep, from the fourth review round.** Follow-ups for the two together:
  the pending chain follows first parents, while both providers' commit listings follow every
  parent, so a queued merge's side branch is missing from `listCommits()` until its push lands;
  a queued push to the target (GitHub: base) branch is not overlaid onto the comparison, as
  GitHub's `#simulatedPullComparison` documents — it changes the reviewed diff only when the
  push moves the merge base, and the fix is a merge-base walk over the cache; creates and
  comments record the new id only after the POST returns, so when the reply is lost in transit
  the retried apply posts a duplicate (GitLab's review shows the remedy: record the step as
  under way, then ask the provider what landed before repeating it); revert snapshots
  (`previousTitle` and the like) come from the overlay, so they can include queued actions
  nobody approved — latent while nothing calls `revertAction`; and a read racing an apply can
  serve a created item twice, provisional and real — GitHub's listings, searches and pull
  request discussion never deduplicate, and GitLab's listings do (`identity`) but its discussion
  read builds the provisional entries before it fetches the thread, so an apply landing during
  that fetch shows its comment twice.
- **Cascaded rejections in the Workshop.** `rejectAction`'s contract leaves a `restart` to the
  overseer, "possibly after rejecting other actions", but the overseer's `rejectAction` ignores
  the answer: the gadget is not restarted, and the records a cascade retired keep pending
  cards. Discarding one reaches the gatekeeper again, which this port answers with success (and
  an approval with the reason it cannot run); GitHub answers both with "no longer pending", so
  the card can never be resolved. The remedy is a kernel change of its own — honour `restart`
  and resolve the cascade's cards — and GitHub's half is answering as this port does.
- **Bounded output from the kit's wholesale diff.** `git-diff.ts`'s `wholesaleDiff` runs when a
  file's change exceeds jsdiff's caps and emits *every* changed line as removed-plus-added: a
  fully rewritten 1 MiB file of 30k lines becomes 60k line objects to the agent, which is what
  `diffOmitted` exists for. One condition — past the per-file line cap, omit rather than emit —
  in shared kit code both gatekeepers run, so it lands as its own change rather than inside the
  behaviour-neutral move.
- **The same fixes in gatekeeper-github.** Reviewing this port surfaced gaps the mirror inherited
  and, in some cases, GitHub has worse: `applyAction` is retry-idempotent only for `push` (an
  already-applied action of any type should report success, not "no longer pending");
  `getGitBlob` buffers the whole base64 body before its size check (GitHub serves raw blobs under
  the `application/vnd.github.raw` media type, which can be read with a byte cap); the issue
  listing filters pull requests and touched issues *inside* `fetchPage`, so a full page reads
  short and `StreamingCursor` stops before the next — every page with a pull request on it
  truncates the listing; `/pull/:number` does not match `/pull/7/files`, so a URL to a PR tab
  is refused as matching no resource; `merge()` binds no head (see the locked decision above); and
  `#storeCached` stamps the cache generation at *store* time, so a read whose fetch was in flight
  while an `applyAction` ran to completion is stored as if it reflected the mutation and hides it
  for the cache's lifetime (capture the generation before the loader; skip the store if it moved);
  and `#collectPendingChain` marks only the first-parent chain as simulated, so a local merge's
  side parent is advertised as remote-known and left out of the pack of a later push carrying
  it, which GitHub rejects unless the merge's own push has landed first. Its `StreamingCursor` also
  moves rows into the page before awaiting the next fetch, so a fetch that throws loses them and the
  retry skips past them (this port buffers before it serves and serializes `next()`). Once its
  walk marks side parents, its stored comparison must keep them too: it re-records only the
  first-parent ids (this port's `pendingCommitIds`). Its issue and pull request listings serve a
  provisional row whose create was discarded after the cursor was built (this port's
  `#injectedRowStanding`).
  From the second review round: `resultsPerPage` reaches the cursors unchecked (a `0` makes
  `ArrayCursor` answer `[]` forever and `StreamingCursor` `null` at once — this port checks it
  once at the session boundary, `pageSize()` in `gitlab-sessions.ts`); the `listCommits` path
  filter strips trailing slashes with `/\/+$/`, which CodeQL flags as polynomial (use
  `stripTrailingSlashes`); and the listing comparators break ties by `id.localeCompare`, textual
  order that puts `9` after `10`, where the provider orders by id — immaterial for timestamp
  sorts, decisive for `popularity`/`comments`, where most rows tie. From the third round: the
  reject cascade follows the action's *target* only, so an action whose body cites a rejected
  `#~N` stays pending and fails every apply (this port's `referenceBearingTexts`). From the fourth
  round: rejecting a push leaves the pushes stacked on it pending, though their compare-and-swap
  can no longer succeed, and while they wait their expected old heads — commits GitHub never
  received — pass as GitHub's (`knownShas` in `#collectPendingChain`) and their push marks keep the
  rejected commits readable as pushed (this port's `#rejectActionsStrandedByPush`); a merge whose
  reply was lost is sent again by the retried apply, with no re-read to recognise the pull request
  as merged (this port re-reads on a 405 and accepts a merge at its bound head); `acceptAuthCode`
  frees the nonce before its code exchange and stages the result without asking whether the grant
  it replaces is still live, so a reconnect that starts and commits during that exchange is
  overwritten when the slower one commits (this port stages the connection generation the
  attempt began under and commits through `connect(grant, { ifGeneration })`); and `removeLabels`
  applies `setLabels` with the set computed at prepare from the overlay, so a label an unapproved
  `addLabels` queued reaches GitHub and one a human added since is dropped (this port sends
  GitLab's `remove_labels` delta).
  And its `readDiff()` serves `pulls/{n}/files` as the whole diff, though GitHub lists at most
  3000 files there (this port refuses a diff over GitLab's limits).
  From the same round: its author/assignee filters compare logins exactly, which discards the
  provider's rows for a differently-cased login if GitHub's own match ignores case (unchecked);
  its queued-commit `author` filter is an exact name-or-email match, where GitHub's `author` is a
  login or an email, so it needs its own look rather than this port's substring; a first connect
  whose `complete()` throws clears the grant without revoking it; and both its connect and
  `/oauth` routes call `idFromString` unguarded, so a malformed link or state is a 500.
  And `#simulatedPullComparison` takes the pull's merge base from `compare(base, anchor)`, so a
  queued merge of the base branch into the head diffs against the old fork point and shows the
  base's own changes (this port computes it over the pending ancestry's frontier). That fix lifts
  `#collectPendingChain`'s frontier into `gatekeeper-kit`, so the two gatekeepers share one walk.
  GitHub's compare names one pair's merge base, and it has no multi-commit form, so its frontier
  base is a reduction over pairwise bases, whose criss-cross ties need commit dates to break.
  Not a bug but a gap: GitHub's OAuth has no Worker Preview relay (`gatekeeper-kit/preview-oauth`,
  which google and now gitlab use), so a GitHub connection cannot be completed on an MR preview.
- **`confidential` on `GitLabIssueSummary`.** Reporter-and-above observers may see confidential
  issues, and an agent that knows an issue is confidential can avoid quoting it into a public
  merge request description. A one-field addition to the approved API, deferred to its own review.
- **Merge readiness in the details, and tighter id types.** `approvedBy?` says who approved, not
  whether the rules are met; `approvals_required`/`approvals_left`, from the `GET …/approvals`
  already made, would (until then `mergeStatus: "not_approved"` is the merge-blocking signal).
  `mergeStatus` could be a union of the documented `detailed_merge_status` values with a
  `(string & {})` fallback, and `GitLabIssuableRef.id` a `` `${number}` | `~${number}` ``
  template type. Each changes the approved API, so each gets its own review.
