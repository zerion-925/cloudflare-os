// Pending Chat actions and the read-time overlay that simulates them.
//
// An action submitted for approval is not sent to Google until applyAction() runs, but every read
// through this gatekeeper reflects the queued writes: a queued message appears in the space's
// history, a queued edit shows its new text, and the connected user's queued reactions appear in
// (or vanish from) the detailed reaction list. Aggregate
// reaction counts stay provider-backed, because a count does not say whether the connected user
// is already included in it.
//
// The overlay is computed at read time rather than by mutating a cache, so rejecting an action
// simply removes it and the next read is correct again. Every function here is pure and takes the
// paging position it needs as arguments, which is what lets the simulation be tested without a
// Durable Object and keeps a page's result independent of what earlier pages returned.
