// The verifier interface the Google gatekeepers call on their own `GatekeeperUserVerifier`.
//
// `GatekeeperUserVerifier` is an opaque token with no methods of its own, so each vendor extends
// it with the questions its gatekeepers need answered about a prospective observer. The overseer
// only ever hands a verifier back to a gatekeeper of the same vendor, which is what makes the
// cast in each `addObserver()` safe.
//
// It lives in its own module so that a gatekeeper implemented outside google.ts (Chat) can name
// the interface without importing the module that implements it, which also re-exports it.
