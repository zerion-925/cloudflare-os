 * bundle inlining one (a JSON data file, say) does not remove it, because a module the blueprint
 * still ships may import it too -- so a blueprint written in JavaScript builds exactly as it did
 * before TypeScript was allowed here.
 *
 * A gadget library is inlined the same way. The blueprint imports it by this package's name
 * (`<PACKAGE_NAME>/libraries/<name>/<side>`), and esbuild is given that name as an alias for the
 * package root, so the import resolves to the libraries beside this module without a
 * `node_modules` above the blueprint: a `BUNDLED_BLUEPRINTS_DIR` tree elsewhere builds against the
 * libraries this build ships with. The blueprint stays self-contained -- a gadget created from the
 * blueprint carries its own copy of the library as of its instantiation, and nothing resolves the
 * package name at runtime.
 *
 * Bundles are readable rather than minified, because the agent edits the installed file, and
 * tree-shaking annotations are ignored, so a `"sideEffects": false` in an enclosing package.json
 * cannot drop a side-effect-only import (see the option below). The only imports that survive are
 * the ones the entry's runtime supplies (see {@link ENTRY_POINTS}); every other specifier has to
 * resolve to a file the blueprint owns or to a gadget library. esbuild enforces that for bare
 * specifiers, which it resolves or fails on, but not for URLs: `import x from "https://..."` is
 * left in the output as an external without a word, so the bundle's surviving imports are checked
 * against the entry's allowlist here.
 *
 * Rejected, rather than silently mis-shipped: a JavaScript module in a tree that holds TypeScript,
 * which would ship as written beside bundles it cannot share code with -- a blueprint is written in
 * one or the other; a `package.json` inside a TypeScript tree, whose `browser` field or `imports`
 * map would steer the bundler's resolution of the blueprint's own modules away from what the type
 * check saw, and a module the bundler resolved to another of the blueprint's files by way of a
 * `package.json` above the tree, which the in-tree refusal cannot see (see {@link auditInputs});
 * a `.ts` file that is neither an entry nor under `lib/`; a TypeScript
 * dialect the blueprint has no place for (see {@link UNSUPPORTED_TYPESCRIPT_PATTERN}); a `lib/`
 * module no entry imports, which would be dropped from the blueprint; an input the bundle inlined that is
 * neither one of the blueprint's own files nor a library reached by its package subpath, from the
 * right side, which would inline code the blueprint does not own (see {@link auditInputs}); a
 * dynamic `import()` or `require()` of anything but a string literal, refused from the source
 * before the bundler could expand a pattern into every file it matches (see {@link scanModule}),
 * and again in the output should one reach it through a library (see {@link auditInputs}); a
 * module that binds the name `require`, which the scan would read as the module loader and the
 * bundler would not (see {@link ModuleScan.rebindsRequire}); a
 * generated `client.js` or `server.js` that collides with a file or directory the tree already
 * holds; a reference to `require` the bundler could not resolve away, which would throw when

 * modules -- is refused, so the package subpath is the libraries' only door and a library's `src/`
 * is not reachable from a blueprint by any path. An import written inside a library may reach any
 * module under `libraries/`, but never `node_modules`: a library's npm dependency would be inlined
 * into a blueprint nothing audits. An input inside files/ that a blueprint module imported must be
 * the one module its specifier names (see {@link resolveWithinFiles}), so a `browser` field or
 * `imports` map in a `package.json` above the blueprint cannot swap one of the blueprint's modules
 * for another behind the type check's back. An external import is not an input and is not walked;
 * the bundle's surviving imports are checked against the entry's runtime in
 * {@link bundleTypeScriptSources}.
 *
 * One kind of edge is external without being an import the runtime will see: a dynamic `import()`
 * of a template literal with substitutions, which esbuild expands into a glob -- every `.js` under
 * `lib/`, for `` import(`./lib/${name}.js`) `` -- and records as an external edge with the wildcard
 * path, while the files it matched -- anywhere the pattern reaches, including outside files/ --
 * become inputs no edge points at, and the output calls a glob helper rather than `import()`. The
 * walk rejects the wildcard edge, and then requires that it met every input the metafile lists, so
 * a bundle that inlines something no import brought in is refused whatever produced it. The edge
 * is reached only from a library's code: a blueprint's own files are refused before the build (see
 * {@link scanModule}), which is the first line; this is the backstop.
 *
 * Types are erased before esbuild builds this graph, so an `import type` of the wrong side is not
 * seen here and not an error: nothing of it reaches the bundle.
