# Bundled blueprints

This package holds the blueprints that ship with this repo, the gadget libraries they import, and
the build that turns a blueprint directory into the files the Workshop backend installs. A fresh
deployment installs the blueprints into BLUEPRINTS KV and BLUEPRINT_CONTENT R2 on its first `/api`
request, after which they are ordinary blueprints, and promotes them as its standard output formats.
"Bundled" is what this package holds; "format" is a curation state an admin controls at runtime --
a bundled blueprint can be taken out of the formats menu, and an unbundled one promoted into it.

Nothing here is deployed on its own. The Workshop backend's `scripts/build-bundled-blueprints.ts`
imports `src/` to generate the gitignored `src/generated/bundled-blueprints.ts` it compiles the
blueprints into, and `pnpm import:bundled-blueprint` (the same package) writes into `blueprints/`.

## Layout

```
blueprints/<name>/     one bundled blueprint, committed as reviewable source
  blueprint.json       install ID, presentation, provenance, bindings, version, revision
  files/               the gadget's code; may contain nested directories
    README.md
    client.ts          import { el } from "@gadgets/bundled-blueprints/libraries/ui/client"
    server.ts          import { MutationQueue } from ".../libraries/sync/server"
    lib/protocol.ts    the document, operation and RPC types both sides share
  __tests__/           vitest, repo-only; never part of the blueprint
libraries/<name>/      a gadget library: client.ts, server.ts, src/**, __tests__/** (see libraries/README.md)
src/                   the build: source and archive reader (files.ts), manifest parser
                       (manifest.ts), module generator (generate.ts); index.ts is what the backend imports
__tests__/             the build's own tests
```

`files/` is the gadget's code. `blueprint.json` contains its install ID, presentation, provenance,
bindings, blueprint `version`, and bundled `revision`. The build embeds the manifest and the files,
as built, in the generated Worker module. No binary archive is committed, and none is built.

Installing a blueprint makes a git commit of its files, as publishing one from a Workshop does, and
stores it as a packfile. The commit has no parent and a fixed author, date and message, so it
depends on the files and nothing else: every deployment that installs the same files installs the
same commit, and a blueprint whose files have not changed is the same commit however often it is
installed. A bundled blueprint's versions are not chained to one another the way a published
blueprint's releases are: each is a commit on its own.

### Libraries

A blueprint may import the shared **gadget libraries** in `libraries/` (see [its
README](libraries/README.md)) by this package's name and the subpath its `package.json` exports:
`@gadgets/bundled-blueprints/libraries/<name>/client` from its client, `.../<name>/server` from its
server. The build resolves each to the library's entry and inlines what the entry uses into the
shipped `client.js` / `server.js`, as it does a `lib/` module, so the blueprint stays
self-contained and a gadget created from it carries its own copy of the library as of its
instantiation. A client may not import a library's server side (it would drag a Durable Object into
the iframe), and a library, reached by that subpath, is the one thing an import may reach outside
`files/` for. The importer has to be TypeScript: a JavaScript module ships as written, with nothing
at runtime to resolve the package name against, so it cannot import a library, and the build rejects
the attempt. The Docs, Sheets and Slides blueprints are built on the `ui` and `sync` libraries, with
their own domain code in `files/`.

### TypeScript sources

`files/` may be written in TypeScript: `client.ts` and `server.ts` are the entry points, and
`lib/**/*.ts` holds the modules they import (by on-disk name, `./lib/protocol.ts`). The build bundles
each entry with its imports into the `client.js` / `server.js` the blueprint ships -- readable
rather than minified -- so the installed gadget, and the agent that later edits it, see exactly one
JavaScript file per side, the same as for a blueprint written in plain JavaScript. Those `lib/`
modules are build input only and are not stored, and `.d.ts` files are dropped. The bundled Docs,
Sheets and Slides blueprints are written this way, each with a `lib/protocol.ts` holding the types
its client and server share (imported type-only, so nothing of it ships).

Everything else under `files/` (the README, assets) passes through unchanged, and may be imported
for its contents where the bundler can inline it: JSON is; a stylesheet is not, and
`import "./styles.css"` fails the build (a gadget carries its CSS in the module that injects it). A file a bundle inlined is still shipped, because
only TypeScript is build input. A blueprint is written in TypeScript or in JavaScript, not both: a
`.js` module in a tree that holds `.ts` is rejected, since it would ship as written beside bundles
it cannot share code with. Non-module files pass through either way.

`cloudflare:workers` is the only import left for the runtime to resolve, and only on the server:
the client is loaded as an ES module in a sandboxed iframe with nothing to resolve a bare import
against, and the server as a Durable Object whose module map holds the gadget's own files and whose
loader supplies no other `cloudflare:` module. Everything else a blueprint imports must be a file it
owns or a library, so `import "yjs"` is a build error rather than a module that goes missing inside
the sandbox, and tree-shaking annotations are ignored, so a `"sideEffects": false` in an enclosing
package.json cannot drop a side-effect-only import from the bundle.

The build rejects a tree that would otherwise ship something other than what was written: a
JavaScript module in a TypeScript blueprint, a `package.json` in a TypeScript blueprint (its `browser`
field or `imports` map would steer the bundler's resolution), an import of one of the blueprint's
modules that the bundler resolved to something other than the module TypeScript resolves it to (a
`package.json` above the blueprint steering it, or an extensionless file the bundler takes first), a
`.ts` file outside the entry/`lib/`
layout, TypeScript spelled `.tsx`/`.mts`/`.cts`, declarations included (neither runtime has a loader
for it), a `lib/` module
no entry imports, an import that reaches outside `files/` by any path other than a library's exported
subpath (a relative or absolute path into `libraries/`, a `src/` module, the package root, a bare
specifier some `node_modules` resolves), a library import of the wrong side or of a library that does
not exist, a
dynamic `import()` or `require()` of anything but a string literal, refused before the bundler runs
(it would leave a computed path unchecked, and expand a template literal or concatenation into every
file the pattern matches, wherever that reaches), a module that binds the name `require` (the scan
reads a bare `require(...)` as the module loader, as the bundler does only while the name is
unbound), a generated `client.js`/`server.js` that collides
with a file or directory already in the tree, or a shipped JavaScript module that imports a library,
which only the bundle can inline. Imports are read from each module's syntax tree with the
TypeScript compiler, so a comment or a string can neither masquerade as one nor hide one.

### Type checks and tests

```
pnpm exec vp run -F @gadgets/bundled-blueprints build   # the five type-check programs
pnpm --filter @gadgets/bundled-blueprints test:run      # the blueprints', libraries' and build's tests
pnpm --filter @gadgets/bundled-blueprints test:watch
```

`pnpm build` type-checks all of it, through one config per set of globals -- the sets must not see
each other, since a Durable Object has no `document`, iframe code cannot import
`cloudflare:workers`, and neither has Node's `fs`:

| config | covers | globals |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tsconfig.client.json` | every `client.ts` (blueprints and libraries) and what it imports | DOM |
| `tsconfig.server.json` | every `server.ts` and what it imports | Workers |
| `tsconfig.tests.json` | the blueprints' and libraries' `__tests__/` and what they import | DOM + Node |
| `tsconfig.server-tests.json` | `__tests__/server.test.ts` and `__tests__/*.server.test.ts`, the tests of a server side | Workers + Node |
| `tsconfig.node.json` | `src/` and `__tests__/`, the build and its tests | Node |

Each follows its entries' imports, so a `lib/` or `src/` module is checked under the globals of
whichever side imports it, and a module both sides import under both -- which is what keeps a
shared module honest without forcing a server-only one to compile against the DOM. A library import
is this package referring to itself by name, which tsc resolves through the `exports` in
`package.json` with no `paths` block, so a blueprint is checked against the real signatures it
imports.

### What the build does not check

The bundler and the type check are kept in step by refusing what would let them diverge, not by
supporting every way TypeScript can be written. Write a blueprint the plain way -- `.ts` modules
under `files/`, relative imports spelled `./name.ts` or `./lib/name.ts`, libraries by the package
subpath -- and stay inside these limits, which the build does not enforce:

- A `/// <reference types="…" />`, `lib="…"` or `path="…"` directive loads types the side's tsconfig
  deliberately leaves out (`types: []`, one `lib` per side), so `Buffer` type-checks in a client and
  ships as a free global that throws in the iframe. Do not write one: a gadget module sees exactly
  the globals its runtime supplies, and the type check is only as honest as that isolation.
- A tree under `BUNDLED_BLUEPRINTS_DIR` is bundled but not type-checked; the programs above cover
  this package's `blueprints/` and `libraries/` only. Type-check such a tree in its own workspace.
- The comment naming each inlined library module is rewritten line by line, so the bundle is the
  same wherever it is built; a template literal whose own line spells exactly such a path would be
  rewritten with it.

Unit tests of a blueprint's `lib/` modules, or of its server, live in the blueprint's `__tests__/`
and run under `pnpm test` (jsdom by default; a pure module's or a server's test declares
`// @vitest-environment node`). They import the module under test by on-disk name, e.g.
`../files/lib/protocol.ts`, and load a fixture with `readFileSync`. A test of the server side is
named `server.test.ts` or `<topic>.server.test.ts`, which is what puts it under the Workers types
rather than the DOM's; at run time it gets `cloudflare:workers` as a stub of its base classes
(`__tests__/stubs/cloudflare-workers.ts`), so a Durable Object can be constructed over in-memory
storage. The blueprints the build produces are still installed and inspected inside workerd by the
Workshop backend's suite. Only `blueprint.json` and `files/` are read by the build, so `__tests__/`
(and anything else beside them) is repo-only and never part of the blueprint.

`blueprintId` is the install key. Never change it after deployment: the new ID would install a
second blueprint while the old one remained. (TODO: the bundled IDs keep the historical `format.`
prefix -- `format.document`, `format.spreadsheet`, `format.slides` -- for that reason; renaming them
needs an install-time migration keyed on the old id.) `version` is the blueprint's published content
version, a counter for display: the content itself is stored under the commit of its files. The
build fingerprints the files and the rest of the manifest, so direct edits under `files/` reinstall
automatically. `revision` remains an explicit reinstall trigger and is bumped by the importer.

## Editing presentation

Edit `blueprint.json` and rebuild. Changes to title, description, output, or author are included in
the install fingerprint and do not need a `revision` bump.

## Updating code

Build the blueprint in a Workshop, export it, then import the export, from `packages/workshop-backend`:

```
pnpm import:bundled-blueprint ~/Downloads/Gadgets-Doc-v4.gadget format.document
```

The importer replaces `files/` and leaves anything beside `blueprint.json` and `files/` alone,
updates archive-owned metadata (`created`, `version`, `lastUpdated`, and `bindings`), bumps
`revision`, rebuilds the backend's `src/generated/bundled-blueprints.ts`, and reports changed files
and bindings. An export the build rejects is refused before it replaces
anything. Review the resulting source diff normally.

An export is a `.gadget` archive in one of two versions, and the importer reads both. Version 1
holds a snapshot of the blueprint's files. Version 2, which a Workshop writes for anything published
since blueprints became git commits, holds a git packfile, and the importer has `git` unpack it.
Only the files are taken from either: the bundled blueprint's commit is made from them at install,
not copied from the export.

An export contains the bundled JavaScript, so importing one over a TypeScript blueprint replaces its
sources with the built `client.js` / `server.js`. Edit a TypeScript blueprint in the repo instead,
and use the Workshop only to try the result.

## Adding a format

```
pnpm import:bundled-blueprint ~/Downloads/Brief.gadget --new acme-brief
```

This extracts the files and writes a valid scaffolded `blueprint.json`. Before deploying, replace
the scaffold description and review `output`. Prefer a generic `output.id` such as `document`; the
Outputs page uses it to group related formats.

## Shipping your own formats

`BUNDLED_BLUEPRINTS_DIR` points the build at another directory in this same extracted layout. It is
resolved against `packages/workshop-backend`, where the build runs (the variable used to be called
`FORMAT_BLUEPRINTS_DIR`; that name is no longer read, so a deployment setting it builds the bundled
set instead):

```
BUNDLED_BLUEPRINTS_DIR=../../acme-formats pnpm exec vp run build
```

The named directory replaces this set rather than extending it. It can be empty to ship no bundled
formats. The import command honors the same variable. Keeping deployment-owned formats outside this
repo avoids modifying it when it is consumed as a submodule.

A `BUNDLED_BLUEPRINTS_DIR` tree may be written in TypeScript like the blueprints here, and the build
bundles it the same way: a syntax error or an import that does not resolve fails the build, and it
imports the gadget libraries by the same package name, which the build resolves to this package's
`libraries/` without the tree having installed anything. It is not type-checked, though. This
package's `tsconfig.*.json` programs are static and cover only `blueprints/` and `libraries/`, so a
tree elsewhere needs its own `tsc` run in the repository that owns it, with
`@gadgets/bundled-blueprints` linked into that workspace the way `@gadgets/scripts` already must
be, so its editor and `tsc` resolve the same `exports`; or it can stay JavaScript.

Directories using the previous `<name>.gadget` plus `<name>.json` layout remain supported, so an
existing deployment can update this repo without coordinating a format conversion. Importing a new
export into one of those entries migrates that pair to the extracted layout automatically. That is
also the only way to update one: the layout holds version 1 archives, and the build refuses a
version 2 export dropped in a `<name>.gadget`'s place.

Administrators can also publish and promote ordinary blueprints at runtime instead of rebuilding a
deployment.
