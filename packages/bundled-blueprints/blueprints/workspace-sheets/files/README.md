## Using the spreadsheet

- Click a cell to select it.
- Double-click a cell, press **F2**, or begin typing to edit it.
- Start formulas with `=`, for example:
  - `=SUM(A1:A10)`
  - `=IF(B2>100,"High","Low")`
  - `=VLOOKUP(E2,A2:C20,3,FALSE)`
  - `=Sheet2!A1*2`
- Use the name box to jump to a cell or range such as `D12` or `A1:C8`.
- Right-click the grid for cut/copy/paste and row or column actions.
- Double-click a sheet tab to rename it; right-click it to duplicate or delete it.

## Programmatic population

The spreadsheet can be read and populated through the Gadget's server RPC methods. This is useful for scripts, agents, migrations, or seeding a workbook without using the grid UI.

### Read the workbook

Call `getDocument()` to retrieve the complete persisted workbook:

```js
const doc = await gadget.getDocument();
```

The returned object contains `revision`, `title`, `sheetOrder`, `sheets`, `cells`, and `lastModified`. Cells are grouped by sheet ID and keyed by A1 reference:

```js
const firstSheetId = doc.sheetOrder[0];
const a1 = doc.cells[firstSheetId].A1;
// { value: "Revenue", fmt: { b: true }, version: 1 }
```

### Write cells

Use `applyOperation()` with per-cell operations. For a new cell, use `baseVersion: 0`; when replacing or deleting an existing cell, use its current `version` from `getDocument()`.

```js
const doc = await gadget.getDocument();
const sheetId = doc.sheetOrder[0];
const cells = doc.cells[sheetId];

const result = await gadget.applyOperation({
  senderId: "seed-script",
  cellOps: [
    {
      sheetId,
      ref: "A1",
      value: "Revenue",
      fmt: { b: true, bg: "#fff3a3" },
      baseVersion: cells.A1?.version ?? 0,
    },
    {
      sheetId,
      ref: "B1",
      value: "=SUM(B2:B10)",
      fmt: { nf: "currency", d: 2 },
      baseVersion: cells.B1?.version ?? 0,
    },
  ],
});
```

A cell's `value` is always stored as text. Begin a value with `=` to create a formula. To delete a cell completely, send both `value: null` and `fmt: null` with the current `baseVersion`.

Check `result.status` after writing. It is `applied`, `unchanged`, or `conflict`. On a conflict, inspect `result.conflicts`, re-read the document, and retry against the latest cell versions rather than overwriting blindly.

### Replace a whole sheet

For bulk imports, `sheetReplacements` is more efficient than sending many individual cell operations:

```js
await gadget.applyOperation({
  senderId: "csv-import",
  sheetReplacements: [{
    sheetId,
    cells: {
      A1: { value: "Name", fmt: { b: true }, version: 1 },
      B1: { value: "Total", fmt: { b: true }, version: 1 },
      A2: { value: "Example", fmt: null, version: 1 },
      B2: { value: "1250", fmt: { nf: "currency", d: 2 }, version: 1 },
    },
  }],
});
```

A whole-sheet replacement overwrites that sheet's complete cell map, so merge with existing data first if it must be preserved. It does not use per-cell conflict checks.

### Change workbook structure

Pass a complete structure snapshot to change the title, sheet order, names, dimensions, or sizing metadata. Because structure uses last-writer-wins semantics, start with the latest document and preserve every sheet that should remain:

```js
const doc = await gadget.getDocument();
const sheetId = doc.sheetOrder[0];

await gadget.applyOperation({
  senderId: "setup-script",
  structure: {
    title: "Quarterly plan",
    sheetOrder: doc.sheetOrder,
    sheets: {
      ...doc.sheets,
      [sheetId]: {
        ...doc.sheets[sheetId],
        name: "Summary",
        colWidths: { ...doc.sheets[sheetId].colWidths, 0: 180 },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Omitting an existing sheet from `sheetOrder` deletes it and its stored cells. Adding a new sheet ID creates empty storage for it. When adding a sheet and its initial data together, include both `structure` and a matching `sheetReplacements` entry in the same operation.

Formatting keys accepted by the server are `b` (bold), `i` (italic), `u` (underline), `s` (strikethrough), `c` (text color), `bg` (fill color), `a` (`l`, `c`, or `r` alignment), `nf` (number format), `d` (decimal places), `fs` (font size), and `wrap`. Colors must be hexadecimal strings such as `#1d1d20`.

## Architecture

Both sides are built on the shared gadget libraries in `packages/bundled-blueprints/libraries`, which the build
inlines into the `client.js` and `server.js` it ships.

`@gadgets/bundled-blueprints/libraries/ui/client` draws the chrome: the element builder, the shared
toolbar icons and controls (icon and segment buttons, groups, colour pickers, the dropdown behind the
number-format menu), the in-page prompt that stands in for the `window.prompt` the sandbox blocks,
and the save-status dot. `@gadgets/bundled-blueprints/libraries/sync/client` and `.../sync/server` are the
collaboration loop: the debounced, serialized, retrying save scheduler, the presence roster and
heartbeat, the subscriber object the server calls back on, and in the Durable Object the mutation
queue and the subscriber registry with its presence announcements (whose broadcasts are never
awaited, so a callback may re-enter the queue). `@gadgets/bundled-blueprints/libraries/zip/server`
provides the streaming ZIP writer used by XLSX export. The cell model, the formula engine, the grid,
sheet tabs and the export-specific code are this gadget's own.

In the repository the source is TypeScript under `blueprints/workspace-sheets/files/`
(`client.ts`, `server.ts`, `lib/protocol.ts`, `lib/formula.ts`, `lib/xlsx.ts`), which the build bundles
into the `client.js` and `server.js` shipped here.

### `client.js`

Builds the entire browser interface in JavaScript. It contains:

- Grid rendering and selection behavior
- Cell editing, formatting, sorting, and structural operations
- Formula tokenization, parsing, evaluation, and display formatting
- Clipboard and keyboard support
- A local model whose saves are queued per cell and flushed by the library's scheduler
- RPC callbacks for live server operations and presence events

Formula evaluation happens in the browser. The engine caches computed cells, detects circular references, supports ranges and cross-sheet references, and displays standard errors including `#DIV/0!`, `#VALUE!`, `#REF!`, `#NAME?`, `#N/A`, `#NUM!`, and `#CYCLE!`.

### `server.js`

Exports the Durable Object class `Gadget`, which is the authoritative persistence and synchronization layer. It:

- Stores spreadsheet metadata and each sheet's cells in Durable Object storage
- Serializes mutations and document snapshots through the library's mutation queue
- Applies per-cell optimistic concurrency using cell versions
- Uses last-writer-wins semantics for document structure
- Broadcasts operations and presence events through the library's subscriber registry after the queue releases, best-effort and without awaiting them, so a callback may itself read or write the document and a hung subscriber holds up only its own client
- Sanitizes titles, dimensions, cell contents, references, and formatting
- Advertises and produces the server-side workbook and CSV exports

### XLSX and ZIP modules (bundled into `server.js`)

The XLSX module converts a complete document snapshot into a streaming XLSX workbook: sparse
worksheet XML with inline strings, deduplicated styles, and frozen panes. The ZIP module is a
dependency-free streaming ZIP writer (raw DEFLATE via `CompressionStream`, incremental CRC32, data
descriptors). Both are bundled into `server.js`.

## Storage model

The server stores:

- `meta`: revision, title, sheet order, sheet metadata, and modification time
- `cells:<sheetId>`: a map of A1 references to `{ value, fmt, version }`

Default sheets have 100 rows and 26 columns. Server validation permits up to 50,000 rows and 702 columns per sheet. Cell values are limited to 8,192 characters, and titles are limited to 200 characters.

## Collaboration notes

The server and client synchronization code support multiple connected clients and live updates. Each
tab introduces itself with the guest name and colour the sync library derives from its client ID, and
reports its selected range on the library's throttle and heartbeat. Remote collaborator badges and
selection overlays are currently disabled in the UI, so the app presents as a single-user spreadsheet
even though remote operations still synchronize.

## Current limitations

- There is no file import workflow; clipboard operations use tab-separated text.
- Structural edits and sorting clear local undo/redo history.
- Formula reference adjustment during row/column changes is limited to references on the current sheet.
- Formula support is broad but is not intended to be fully compatible with Excel or Google Sheets.
- Frozen row/column metadata exists in the model, but the current UI does not expose controls for it.

## CSV export

Up to 31 worksheets are exposed as individual **CSV** export options, leaving one of the platform's
32 format slots for XLSX. CSV files contain the stored cell values through the worksheet's used
range. Formula cells are exported as their raw formulas (for example, `=SUM(A1:A10)`), not as
browser-computed display values. Fields use standard CSV quoting and CRLF line endings.

## XLSX export

**Excel Workbook** exports one XLSX file with the worksheets in workbook order. Cells keep their
font, color, fill, alignment, number format, decimal places and wrapping; sheets keep column widths,
row heights and frozen panes. Pixel sizes are converted to points (rows, fonts) or approximate
character widths (columns), so layout is close but not pixel-identical.

Cell values follow the grid's own literal rules: a leading apostrophe forces text, a leading `=` is
a formula (whatever the number format), `TRUE`/`FALSE` are booleans, and numbers may carry a sign,
commas, a leading `$` or a trailing `%`. Everything else is text; date-looking text is not parsed.

Formulas are written without cached results and the workbook requests a full recalculation on open,
so Excel evaluates them itself. To keep them valid there, the exporter rewrites cross-sheet
references to the exported worksheet names, prefixes OOXML "future functions" (`IFS`, `CONCAT`, ...)
with `_xlfn.`, renames `ERRORTYPE()` to `ERROR.TYPE()`, and drops whitespace between a function
name and its `(`. A formula that is empty, structurally unbalanced (unterminated string or quoted
name, mismatched parentheses or brackets — the grid's parser tolerates these) or that would exceed
Excel's 8,192-character limit after rewriting is exported as text, since one such formula makes
Excel report the whole workbook as damaged. Formula semantics are otherwise not translated (for
example `^` associativity differs, and a reference outside the grid such as `XFE1` is empty here
but `#NAME?` in Excel), and compatibility with Excel is not claimed beyond this.

Worksheet names are made Excel-safe: invalid characters become `_`, blank names become `Sheet`,
names are cut to 31 characters, and case-insensitive collisions get ` (2)`, ` (3)`, ... suffixes.
References resolve to the first worksheet with a matching source name, as in the grid.

Filters, charts, comments and pivot tables are not exported; cells already materialized from them
export as ordinary values.
