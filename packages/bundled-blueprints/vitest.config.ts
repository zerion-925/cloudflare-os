/**
 * Two projects, because the two kinds of test here need two environments.
 *
 * - `gadgets`: unit tests of the blueprints' and the libraries' own TypeScript sources
 *   (`blueprints/<name>/__tests__/**`, `libraries/<name>/__tests__/**`). These are gadget modules,
 *   so they get a jsdom document by default; a pure module's test opts into node with a
 *   `// @vitest-environment node` header. A blueprint's `@gadgets/bundled-blueprints/libraries/...`
 *   import is this package referring to itself by name, which Vite resolves through the `exports`
 *   in package.json with no alias; `cloudflare:workers` is aliased to a stub of its base classes,
 *   so a module that declares a Durable Object can be imported at all -- the blueprints the build
 *   produces are still installed and inspected inside workerd by the Workshop backend's suite.
 * - `build`: the build itself (`__tests__/**`), whose TypeScript bundling drives esbuild's native
 *   binary. Node code, run under node.
