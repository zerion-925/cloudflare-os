// The operational-transform representation of uncommitted code changes.
//
// A chat's uncommitted state is a sequence of `CodeChange`s applied on top of committed gadget
// code (see ChatCodeBase in the API): every producer -- human keystrokes, agent tool edits,
// update-from-mainline merges -- expresses its change against the chat content as of some
// revision, and the server serializes them into one revisioned stream per chat. A change
// carries no base content, only "a change relative to revision N", which is what lets it
// compose with git-backed storage (the base is always some commit's tree plus earlier changes).
//
// This module is the single owner of the code-change invariants: the wire types, application,
// composition, transformation, diffing, the ingestion validation, and the priority convention
// all live here and nowhere else. The text-OT core is `@codemirror/state`'s ChangeSet (the
// substrate of @codemirror/collab), and change generation uses `fast-diff`; both are private to
// this module -- not because they might be swapped out, but so the invariants stay in one
// place. The wire carries our own plain-JSON types (structurally ChangeSet's compact JSON
// form), keeping the RPC contract self-describing.
//
// Priority convention (fixed here, used identically on both sides of the wire): for two changes
// made concurrently against the same revision, *the change the server ordered earlier comes
// first* -- its inserts precede the later change's at equal positions. This is exactly
// ChangeSet's documented transform law: `A.compose(B.map(A))` and `B.compose(A.map(B, true))`
// produce the same document. `transformCodeChange(a, b)` bakes the pairing in; nothing else may
// call the underlying `map`.
//
// Trust boundary: changes from clients are validated in two stages, and the stages must stay in
// this order. `validateCodeChangeSchema` runs *before* any transform -- transformation is
// structural and must only ever see well-formed changes -- while `validateCodeChangeContent`
// runs *after* transforming the change to the server's current revision, because lengths and
// boundaries are only meaningful against the content the change will actually apply to.
//
// Both stages take a `CodeChange`, and that parameter type is a precondition rather than a
// hope: the declared shape is established before they run, by capnweb-validate's generated
// validator at the RPC edge (Overseer.submitCodeChange) and by the compiler for the one
// in-process producer (the agent's AgentHooks.commitAgentStep, whose changes this module
// itself builds). So neither stage re-checks that a value is an object, an array, a pair, or a
// string; they check the invariants a TypeScript type cannot express -- canonical gadget keys,
// path rules, size caps, integer section lengths, and the one variant rule the wire validator's
// first-match union misses (see validateFileChangeSchema).
//
// Validation's resource-exhaustion goal is deliberately modest: reject anything the caps rule
// out in at most one linear pass over input the RPC layer already parsed (with cheap early
// exits where they fall out naturally), and no more. Change producers hold edit rights, and a
// user who can edit the workspace can do far worse than burn the workspace server's CPU; the
// isolate memory limit bounds the blast radius. The size caps exist first for correctness --
// composed changes get stored and travel in RPC messages, both of which have hard size limits
// of their own -- not as a DoS defense, so don't grow this file chasing sub-linear rejection of
// every hostile shape.

 * (joined by "\n"; a one-element array is a pure deletion). Because sections tile the whole
 * text, the change carries its exact before- and after-lengths by construction.
