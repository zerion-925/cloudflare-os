// This file defines the API that the AI Gadgets Workshop uses to talk to Adapters. Each Adapter
// provides connectivity to some external service which AI Gadgets can then manipulate. Each
// installation of the Gadgets Workshop may have access to different adapters, typically based on
// the set of internal services used at the particular company.
//
// For instance, there might be adapters for Google Workspace, GitHub, Jira, etc.
//
// Adapters provide access to resources. For instance, a Google Workspace adapter might provide
// access to Google Docs, Spreadsheets, Gmail mailboxes, etc. Each Google Doc, for example, is a
// separate "resource". Adapters are designed to provide object-oriented, capability-based access
// to such resources, enabling the Gadget Workshop to grant a particular Gadget fine-grained
// access to just the things the user wants that Gadget to access.
//
// Each adapter is deployed as a completely independent Workers application from the Gadgets
// Workshop itself, and is provided to the Workshop as a service binding. The Workshop communicates
// with the adapter over JavaScript RPC. The types in this file define that RPC interface. The
// `Adapter` type is the root interface implemented by the service binding.

   *     transient — after `complete()` lets the caller read getAuthenticatedEmail(), the gatekeeper
   *     discards it. Vendors without `providesAuth` ignore this and always use their full scopes.
   *
   * `options.resourceUrlPatterns`, if given, limits the connection to the authorization needed for

   * should NOT try to store it on its own; it should always pass it to `bindHook` for the overseer
   * to store. Why? Because the callback needs to be bound to a particular gatekeeper *session*.
   * At the time you are calling `bindHook()`, the callback is tied to the session that is tied
   * to the `ApprovalQueue`. But that session will end at some point, after which the callback stub
   * you received is revoked. When you call HookInitiator.startHook() later on, that actually
   * initiates a *new* session (returning a new `ApprovalQueue`), and the callback returned then
   * is tied to that session instead.
   *
   * `controller` is an object implemented by the gatekeeper which allows the overseer to enable
   * or disable the hook.
   *
   * The hook is not immediately enabled, as the user may need to approve it first. If and when
   * the user has approved, the overseer will call controller.enable() to request that the the
   * gatekeeper begin delivering hook events. If the user never approves, no call will ever be
   * made. Therefore, the gatekeeper should avoid storing any state until the hook is enabled.
   * Typically, the `HookController` implementation should capture all information it needs to
   * register the hook into `props` so that it doesn't need to store anything elsewhere.
   *
   * In a typical implementation, the gatekeeper may expose an API to the gadget like:
   *
   *     onSomeEvent(callback: RpcStub<SomeInterface>)
   *
   * Where `SomeInterface` can be either an RpcTarget-derived interface, or a function type, but
   * either way the stub must be a persistent stub (see below). The gadget could call `onSomeEvent`
   * directly, but more commonly an agent will call it in a one-off `executeCode` tool call, since
   * this is usually one-time setup, not something that happens programmatically. The
   * implementation of `onSomeEvent` constructs a `HookController` implementation whose `props`
   * specify the details of the event to be hooked, then calls `bindHook()` to register the hook.
   * When the user approves, the overseer calls `controller.enable()`, which takes the provided
   * `HookInitiator` object and stores it somewhere where it can be invoked whenever "SomeEvent"
   * occurs. When the event occurs, first the gatekeeper calls `hookInitiator.startHook()` to
   * notify the overseer that a hook is incoming. The overseer returns back the original `callback`
   * stub along with an `ApprovalQueue`. Next the gatekeeper calls `authorizeObservation()` on the
   * `ApprovalQueue` -- since a hook invocation is almost always an observation of some sort.
   * Finally, it invokes the `callback` object to deliver the event to the gadget.
   *
   * Persistent stubs are (as of this writing) a relatively new feature of the Workers Runtime.
   * A worker can construct an `RpcStub` that is "persistent", meaning it can be stored into
   * Durable Object storage, as well as be used as part of the `props` for a WorkerEntrypoint. To

   * 1. Implements a `[restore](params)` method, then
   * 2. Calls `ctx.restore(params)` to invoke that method.

 * Each workspace maintains a cache of git objects, i.e. commits and their file trees. This cache
 * is used to store code backing gadgets as well as local checkouts of git repositories that the
 * agent is working on.
 *
 * Any gatekeeper that provides access to a remote git repo should populate the workspace's git
 * cache with objects from that repo. This allows the gatekeeper's API to pass around git object
 * IDs (especially commit IDs) without having to provide a whole API for reading the content.
 * An agent can mount a git commit ID as a workpiece, read and edit the files, create new commits,
 * and pass those commit IDs back into the gatekeeper, perhaps to push up to the remote repo.
 *
 * Note that the git cache does NOT include the classic git "ref" layer, i.e. it does not track
 * branches, tags, etc. It is entirely up to a gatekeeper to provide an API for that if desired.
 *
 * The workspace may evict objects from the cache. It expects that after doing so, it can later
 * repopulate it by "pulling" it from the same gatekeeper -- see `Gatekeeper.gitPull()`. The
 * Workspace also expects that if it received a particular object from a particular Gatekeeper, it
 * can also pull all the objects referenced by that object (e.g. a commit's parent, or its file
 * tree) from the same gatekeeper. Thus, the workspace can lazily populate the stuff that it needs.
 *
 * Every `GitCache` stub is scoped to the gatekeeper it was handed to. Reads (`get()`, `has()`,
 * `stat()`) answer for exactly two sets of objects, and return null/false for everything else:
 *
 * 1. Objects which the Gatekeeper itself has previously written to cache using `put()`, or which
 *    were successfully pushed to this gatekeeper by an applied action -- so long as said objects
 *    haven't been evicted in the meantime. In other words, these ane objects that are known to
 *    be on the remote already, and also happen to be available in local cache.
 * 2. Objects queued for push to this gatekeeper by a submitted, not-yet-applied action (see
 *    `ActionDescription.pushedCommits`). These objects are NOT believed to be on the remote
 *    already, but are planned to pushed to it assuming the submitted action is later approved.
 *
 * This is intended to assist the Gatekeeper in simulation: If the Gatekeeper provides an API to
 * the agent/Gadget by which the caller can read back a specific commit, the Gatekeeper should
 * first try to read that commit from cache, and fall back to reading it from the remote. This
