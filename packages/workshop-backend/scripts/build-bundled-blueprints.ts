// Bundles a directory of bundled blueprints into a generated TypeScript module, so the Worker can
// install them with no network access when a deployment first serves /api.
//
// The directory defaults to the blueprints `@gadgets/bundled-blueprints` ships, and
// `BUNDLED_BLUEPRINTS_DIR` points somewhere else (relative to this package's root). That is how a
// deployment ships its own formats: this repo is often a submodule, so a fork can't add files here
// without conflicting on every update -- it keeps its blueprints in its own tree and points the
// build at them. Whatever directory is named *is* the deployment's format set; it replaces this one
// rather than adding to it. The reading, validating and bundling is that package's
// `generateBundledBlueprintsModule`; this script is the command line around it.
//
// `--out <path>` redirects the generated module, which is what lets a test run this generator
// without clobbering the module the package actually compiles. That module is read concurrently by
// sibling tasks (`build:integration-worker` and `test` both depend on `build:bundled-blueprints`),
// so a test writing the default path races them.
