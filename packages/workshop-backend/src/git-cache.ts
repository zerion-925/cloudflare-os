// The workspace git cache: provenance tracking and push authorization over the git object store.
//
// This layers gatekeeper-facing semantics onto the `gitObjects` collection (git-store.ts):
//
// - `GitCacheImpl` is the per-gatekeeper `GitCache` RPC stub (workshop-shared/gatekeeper.ts).
//   Every stub is scoped to the gatekeeper it was minted for; the stub passed to `applyAction()`
//   is additionally bound to the applying action, which is what enables `buildPack()`.
// - `gitObjectMetadata` records, per oid, which gatekeepers' remotes provably possess the object
//   (`onRemote`), which merely claim to (`pullableFrom`), and which queued actions plan to push
//   it (`pendingPush`). The two source sets differ in evidentiary grade: `onRemote` is entered
//   only by a hash-verified put()/push, `pullableFrom` by advertisements and referent recording.
//   An object's sources and its `pendingPush` marks extend to what it refers to as the object
//   is stored, whatever stores it and in whatever order (see `#extendToReferents`).
//   Metadata routinely exists for objects the store does NOT hold (advertised commits,
//   filtered-out tree entries, oversized blobs we declined to store), which is one of the two
//   reasons it is a separate collection -- the other being that reading a `gitObjects` row means
//   reading the whole object content.
// - `ensureGitObjects()` is the pull driver: it routes a fault to the recorded sources and calls
//   `Gatekeeper.gitPull()` through the overseer-provided delegate. It is reachable only from
//   overseer-initiated paths (lazy reads and the pending-push pull-through), so a gatekeeper can
//   never direct a pull of anything outside a verified queued push.
// - `verifyPushAncestry()`/`markPushClosure()` implement `ActionDescription.pushedCommits`
//   authorization at the `submitAction` chokepoint, and the mark lifecycle helpers convert or
//   clear the marks when the action applies, is rejected, or its gatekeeper is deleted.
//
// Trust model note (do not document the view as a confinement boundary): oids are capabilities
// and gatekeepers are trusted with the objects whose oids they know. The scoped read view and
// the ancestry rule are a mistake-safeguard and a simulation aid -- they fail an *accidental*
// push to an unrelated remote closed at queue time -- not defenses against a hostile gatekeeper.
//
// The lazy read paths here (`ensureObject`, `readFileAtCommit`, `listTreeEntries`,
// `readCommitTree`, `readFilesAtCommit`) parse git objects via the hand-rolled codec
// (git-codec.ts) rather than isomorphic-git, because each step must know the expected type and
// the referencing object to shape `GitPullHints`. Writes never fault and stay in git-store.ts on
// isomorphic-git.
