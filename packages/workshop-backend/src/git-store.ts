// The workspace git object store.
//
// Each workspace's Overseer DO holds a real git object database -- SHA-1, zlib-deflated loose
// objects, byte-identical to what `git` itself would write -- stored in the `gitObjects`
// typed-storage collection. Mainline gadget code is (will be, once the commit-backed code flow
// lands) represented as commits in this store, with each GadgetRecord pointing at its head
// commit.
//
// There is deliberately no ref layer: no branches, tags, or HEAD. Our "refs" are the gadget
// records, blueprint records, and chats' pinned commits, all managed by the Overseer's own
// workflow. Because the store is content-addressed and refless, unrelated histories coexist
// freely in the same collection, and related histories (gadgets forked from each other or
// instantiated from the same blueprint) deduplicate at the blob/tree level.
//
// We use real git formats (rather than a git-shaped custom encoding) so that gadget code can
// later be exported to and imported from real git repositories, and so agents can eventually
// "mount" arbitrary repos through gatekeeper-gated push/pull. isomorphic-git provides most of the
// object codec; we use only its plumbing (writeBlob/writeTree/read*), which operates against a
// gitdir containing nothing but `objects/**`. Commits are written by our own encoder instead
// (`encodeGitCommit()` in git-codec.ts), which can add the headers isomorphic-git's cannot. The
// porcelain is off-limits: `git.commit` requires HEAD/index/config, and `git.merge` cannot
// represent the merge behavior we want (see `threeWayMerge`).
//
// Storage notes:
// - Loose objects only, one collection record per object, keyed by oid. isomorphic-git never
//   writes deltified data (it only reads deltas in packfiles fetched from remotes), so each
//   record is a zlib'd whole object. Dedup comes from content addressing, not deltas.
// - No object exceeds ~2MB today (records hold single source files, small trees, and commit
//   headers). If large blobs ever appear, chunking records or spilling to R2 is a change local
//   to the fs shim below.
// - No GC. Dangling objects are only created by accepted merges, imports, migration, loading
//   a blueprint's release (whose objects are stored whether or not anything comes to refer to
//   them), and the merge commits of a chat that is then discarded (an update from mainline
//   commits the chat's files and the merge result, see updateChatFromMainline, and applying a
//   blueprint commits its merge, see applyBlueprint) -- never by a chat's edits -- and are
//   cheap. If GC is ever needed, the roots are
//   enumerable: gadget records (their heads and the blueprint releases they follow), blueprint
//   gadget records (the commits they exported and the releases minted from those), live chats'
//   pinned commits, the pin declarations in chat logs and compaction checkpoints (closed epochs
//   are reconstructed from them), and the `observedOid` blob stamps (and legacy `observedCommit`
//   stamps) on chats' readFile tool calls (which nothing else roots -- a future GC must either
//   root them or the agent's replay must tolerate a missing object by eliding the read).

 * - identical change on both sides (including both deleted): clean;
 * - deleted on one side, changed on the other: the changed content survives, reported as a
 *   conflict;
 * - changed on both sides (including both-added): line merged via diff3, conflicting hunks
 *   marked -- unless any of the three versions, or the merged text, is too large to hold, in
