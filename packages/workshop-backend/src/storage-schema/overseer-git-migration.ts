// Migration of pre-git-storage workspaces: synthesizes git commits from the legacy Yjs code log
// and converts every live chat to the commit-pinned change-stream representation.
//
// Before git-backed code storage, mainline code was a workspace-wide Yjs doc persisted as an
// incremental update log (the `code`/`snapshots` collections), and each chat's uncommitted
// changes were Yjs updates riding its "changes" messages (plus live drafts in
// `chatDraftUpdates`). This module replays that log once and synthesizes, per gadget, a chain of
// real git commits in the workspace's object store, then rewrites every record that referenced a
// code-log version to reference a commit instead: gadget heads (GadgetRecord.commitId),
// historical merge messages (their required `commits` field), and blueprint records
// (codeVersion -> commitId).
//
// The log has limited information about *why* code changed -- essentially just timestamps -- so
// commit points are chosen as:
//   - every code version recorded by a historical `merge` message (each is a moment a user
//     deliberately accepted changes -- the principled commit points);
//   - any version followed by a >= 1 hour gap in the log's timestamps, batching the keystroke
//     bursts old standalone (out-of-chat) editing wrote straight to mainline;
//   - the final version; and
//   - every persisted pinned version -- each live legacy chat's anchor (see
//     legacyChatBaseVersion) and each blueprint's exported codeVersion -- resolved to the last
//     code version at or below it, so the pinned state is exactly some commit's tree.
// Versions where a gadget's flattened files are unchanged from its previous synthesized commit
// are skipped for that gadget, so a gadget untouched by most of the log gets a short chain.
// Every permanent gadget's chain is additionally rooted at a version-0 empty-tree commit, so
// every permanent gadget leaves the migration with a head even if the log never gave it content
// (the invariant chat pinning relies on; see GadgetRecord.commitId).
//
// Each live pre-git chat is then **converted** in place (see
// AiChatMessageBody.conversionBoundary): its legacy doc -- the mainline doc at the chat's anchor
// version, plus its non-reverted "changes" updates, plus any outstanding drafts (which are then
// deleted) -- is flattened once, and its uncommitted state becomes one synthetic "changes"
// message whose `change` is the diff of that flatten against the anchor commits' trees, carrying a
// pin per touched permanent gadget ({baseCommit: anchor, mergedCommit: anchor} -- what arms the
// accept flow's fast-forward gate). Untouched gadgets get no pin (they track head live, the lazy
// semantics); gadgets still pending in the chat get their content as plain `set`s with no pin,
// like any chat-created gadget. The boundary message is written even when there is nothing to
// convert (empty change, no pins): ChatCodeBase.epoch points at it, and replay keys the elision of
// pre-conversion tool reads on it. After conversion the chat is an ordinary new-model chat; the
// pre-conversion messages keep their retired Yjs `update` bytes on disk as rollback insurance,
// but nothing can apply them (delivery strips them; see hydrateChatMessageForClient).
//
// One repair predates all of that: the multi-gadget migration (version 0 -> 1, see
// migrateToMultiGadget) counted only *mainline* code as gadget content, so a workspace
// whose only code was proposed-but-unaccepted chat changes migrated to zero gadgets -- leaving
// that content orphaned in the legacy root "", which no gadget record owns (and which the
// conversion would otherwise silently drop, since the registry is its enumeration source of
// truth). Such content is still the workspace's implicit single gadget, so the migration
// creates its record (via the createDefaultGadget host callback) before synthesizing chains:
// the record is permanent -- several chats may propose against the same root, and each must pin
// one shared head -- gets the ordinary version-0 empty-tree root as its head, and each affected
// chat then converts like any other: pinned at the empty tree with its files as proposed sets.
//
// The migration runs in the Overseer constructor under blockConcurrencyWhile, gated by the
// `version` singleton (see migrateToGitStorage). It is re-runnable: object writes
// are content-addressed (recommitting identical history yields identical oids), every record
// rewrite is deterministic from storage state, and all record writes (chat conversion included)
// happen in one synchronous tail, so a crashed run is simply redone. (Defensively, a chat that
// already has a codeBase is skipped: it was converted by a previous run. A re-run after the
// default gadget's creation flushed sees defaultGadgetId set and doesn't create it again.)
