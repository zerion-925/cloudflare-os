// Collaborator authorization, sharing, and permission-graph logic for a Gadget's Overseer.
//
// This module owns all manipulation of the `collaborators` and `shareKeys` storage collections
// and the permission graph that links them. It deliberately performs no RPC: anything that
// requires talking to a User DO (resolving a profile from a username, fetching the owner's
// profile, notifying a user that a gadget was opened, etc.) stays in the Overseer, which passes
// resolved values (or, where laziness matters, a callback) into this module.
//
// LAZY REVOCATION MODEL: Access is determined by reachability from the owner in the permission
// graph, recomputed live at every open() (see `getEffectiveRole`). Revocation is therefore lazy:
// removing a collaborator only severs the edges granting *them* access, and revoking a share link
// only flags the link revoked. Nothing cascades, no records are deleted, and downstream edges are
// never touched -- users who lose their only path to the owner simply become unreachable and are
// denied at open() time. Because the graph is never destructively pruned, revocation is reversible:
// re-adding a removed collaborator restores them and, transitively, everyone they had shared with
// (unless `ownerInvitesOnly` is set, when only the owner's direct grants count).
// (Records and revoked keys accumulate in storage; a future GC could reclaim long-dead entries.)
//
// NOTE: The sensitive-data (`containsRestrictedData`) policy intentionally does NOT live here; the
// Overseer enforces it. This module only answers questions about the sharing graph. The one
// exception is the `ownerInvitesOnly` flag, which the Overseer supplies as a hook: once it is set,
// only direct grants from the owner count, so it narrows which edges `computeEffectiveRoles`
// follows and must be checked synchronously with each grant's storage write.
