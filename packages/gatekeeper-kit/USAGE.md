# Using `@gadgets/gatekeeper-kit`

The kit exposes independent modules through package subpaths. Import only the pieces the gatekeeper
needs:

```ts
import {
  CredentialCoordinator,
  CredentialSource,
} from "@gadgets/gatekeeper-kit/credentials";
```

The exported symbols carry their exact contracts in JSDoc. This guide covers the choices and
sequencing that span more than one symbol.

## Connect flows

These sequences compose Layer-1 leaves; the kit ships no connect assembly. The conformance account
in [`__tests__/workerd/conformance/gatekeeper.ts`](__tests__/workerd/conformance/gatekeeper.ts) is
the executable reference. Production gatekeepers stage and commit reconnects, but none fences a
connect on its connection generation yet, so the fenced variants below are the recommended shape
rather than established practice. `disposeMintIfSafe`, `revokeLiveGrantBestEffort`, and `toGrant`
are gatekeeper-owned placeholders, not kit exports; `client` is an `OAuthClient` (see
[OAuth token endpoint](#oauth-token-endpoint)).

Every browser connect flow must claim its OAuth nonce before exchanging the provider code. An
expired or replayed callback must not mint a grant. When the attempt advances to OAuth, store the
PKCE verifier and the exact redirect URI with it, and capture the account's connection generation
so a disconnect or newer connect cannot be overwritten during the exchange:

```ts
type ConnectAttempt = { codeVerifier: string; redirectUri: string; startedUnder: string };

const pkce = await createPkce();
const state = advanceToOAuth<ConnectAttempt>(kv, linkNonce, Date.now(), {
  codeVerifier: pkce.codeVerifier,
  redirectUri,
  startedUnder: this.#creds.connectionGeneration(),
});
if (state === null) throw new Error("This connect link has expired. Start again.");
const authorize = client.authorizationUrl({
  redirectUri, state, scopes, codeChallenge: pkce.codeChallenge,
});

const claim = claimOAuth<ConnectAttempt>(kv, oauthNonce, Date.now());
if (claim === null) throw new Error("This connect attempt has expired. Start again.");

const grant = toGrant(await client.exchangeCode({
  code, redirectUri: claim.redirectUri, codeVerifier: claim.codeVerifier,
}));
```

The handshake holds one OAuth nonce, so a second `advanceToOAuth` invalidates the first unclaimed
callback. A claimed attempt can still race with a connection change. Use `startedUnder` in the
matching initial or reconnect path below.

### Initial connect

An initial connect may persist its complete grant in the new account before calling
`callback.complete(user, expiresAt)`. Fence that write, then return the handoff as the final browser
response:

```ts
try {
  this.#creds.connect(grant, { ifGeneration: claim.startedUnder });
} catch (error) {
  if (!isConnectionSuperseded(error)) throw error;
  await disposeMintIfSafe(grant);
  throw new Error("This account's connection changed. Start again.", { cause: error });
}

const handoff = await callback.complete(user, credentialsRefreshabilityExpiry);
return htmlResponse(connectHandoffPageHtml(handoff));
```

Without `ifGeneration`, `connect()` writes unconditionally. That remains appropriate for a pasted
token or form submission with no round trip to fence.

Call `complete()` at most once per account. Each call stages another Workshop ticket, and an
unredeemed ticket revokes the account, so a second call can destroy the connection the first made,
even one that threw or lost its reply. A flow that claimed a single-use nonce reaches `complete()`
once already. A flow whose link or form has no single-use nonce records the attempt: refuse when
`isConnectAttempted(kv)` (early, to skip provider work, and again where the live credential is
written), then mark it in that same synchronous section:

```ts
if (isConnectAttempted(kv)) return refuse();
this.#creds.connect(grant);
markConnectAttempted(kv);
const handoff = await callback.complete(user, credentialsRefreshabilityExpiry);
```

RPC rejection does not prove that `complete()` failed. Workshop may already hold a pending handoff,
or a sign-in may already have linked the account, so a blind rollback can delete credentials the
Workshop is about to activate. The kit has no mechanism for this. An account that keeps its grant
must decide locally when the flow is dead, clear it only if the credential identity it wrote is
still current, and apply provider cleanup only when that cannot invalidate an alias or successor.
Workshop revokes a staged connect whose ticket is never redeemed.

### Reconnect and `ensureResources`

A reconnect or resource expansion must not write the new grant live. Stage the complete canonical
grant together with the generation under which the flow started, report that exact stage, and wait
for Workshop to call `commitReconnect(stageId)`:

```ts
type ReconnectStage = { grant: Grant; startedUnder: string };

if (this.#creds.connectionGeneration() !== claim.startedUnder) {
  await disposeMintIfSafe(grant);
  throw new Error("This account's connection changed while reconnecting. Start again.");
}

const displaced = discardStagedCredentials<ReconnectStage>(this.ctx.storage.kv);
const stageId = stageCredentials(
  this.ctx.storage.kv,
  { grant, startedUnder: claim.startedUnder },
  Date.now(),
);
if (displaced !== null) await disposeMintIfSafe(displaced.grant);

const handoff = await callback.reconnectComplete(stageId, credentialsRefreshabilityExpiry);
return htmlResponse(connectHandoffPageHtml(handoff));
```

Workshop then calls the account's `commitReconnect(stageId)`:

```ts
const staged = commitStagedCredentials<ReconnectStage>(
  this.ctx.storage.kv,
  Date.now(),
  stageId,
);
if (staged === null) throw new Error("This reconnect stage is no longer available.");
const retired = this.#creds.stored();
try {
  this.#creds.connect(staged.grant, { ifGeneration: staged.startedUnder });
} catch (error) {
  if (!isConnectionSuperseded(error)) throw error;
  await disposeMintIfSafe(staged.grant);
  throw new Error("This account's connection changed. Start again.", { cause: error });
}
if (retired !== undefined) await disposeMintIfSafe(retired);
```

No account or resource read may use staged data. A mismatched stage id leaves the newer stage
intact; only an exact, live stage is consumed. Workshop owns the opaque completion ticket and passes
its recorded stage id to `commitReconnect`. The stage TTL controls how long the grant is committable.
The optional `expiresAt` passed to `complete()` or `reconnectComplete()` is a separate absolute
estimate of when the credentials stop being refreshable, not the access-token or stage expiry.

An RPC rejection from `reconnectComplete()` is ambiguous: Workshop may already hold the `stageId`, so
the stage must stay committable. Nothing expires it locally — `commitStagedCredentials` refuses it
once the TTL passes, but the record survives until the next stage replaces it.

`disposeMintIfSafe` belongs to the gatekeeper and must not throw. It revokes only when the provider
guarantees cleanup cannot invalidate live or successor credentials. For grant-wide revocation, it
is a no-op. Capture a live grant or stage before synchronous replacement, then dispose it only after
the successor is live.

Fence rejection reports too: carry the identity of the credentials used by an in-flight provider
call, and ignore its rejection after a successor is live.

Teardown captures first, clears locally, and only then awaits provider cleanup. A revoke or account
deletion clears everything the account owns:

```ts
const live = this.#creds.stored();
const staged = discardStagedCredentials<ReconnectStage>(this.ctx.storage.kv);
await this.ctx.storage.deleteAlarm();
await this.ctx.storage.deleteAll();
if (staged !== null) await disposeMintIfSafe(staged.grant);
if (live !== undefined) await revokeLiveGrantBestEffort(live);
```

`deleteAll` removes the stored Workshop callback, the expiry latch, and the provider keys a
selective sequence would miss, so both captures above must be synchronous and precede it. A provider
await placed before the local clear leaves `commitReconnect` a window to re-arm an account being
deleted.

A path that keeps the account clears selectively instead. Repointing a connection at a new endpoint
discards the stage, deletes the nonce, and calls `CredentialCoordinator.clear()`, leaving the
callback and the alarm in place.

`discardStagedCredentials` returns what it dropped and ignores the stage TTL, so an abandoned grant
is still reachable. A gatekeeper that will not keep an unconfirmed grant at rest can retain the
`stageId` under its own key, arm its own alarm, and pass that id back:
`discardStagedCredentials(kv, stageId)` drops only that stage, so a newer flow's stage survives the
cleanup its predecessor scheduled. No gatekeeper retains stage ids today, so that argument has no
consumer yet. The kit owns no cleanup protocol either. The marker, the alarm, and whether to call
the provider at all stay with the gatekeeper, and a dropped grant goes to `disposeMintIfSafe`, never
to the live keys.

`revokeLiveGrantBestEffort` is also gatekeeper-owned and must not throw. Use the provider's
connection-specific revocation when it has one. Omit remote revocation when the provider cannot
target this connection without invalidating a separate live connection; local teardown still
removes the Workshop's authority.

Neither helper may decide the RPC outcome. Not throwing is not the same as returning: bound the
provider call with `AbortSignal.timeout`, or hand it to `ctx.waitUntil` once the local write is
durable. Each disposal above sits on the path of a reply someone awaits, and `commitReconnect`'s
cannot be retried because Workshop spends the handoff ticket before calling it. A reply lost behind
a hung revocation leaves the new grant live while the account stays marked unrestored.

See [`docs/connect-handoff.md`](../../docs/connect-handoff.md) for Workshop's ticket, popup nonce,
and redemption protocol.

## Credentials

An OAuth-shaped provider needs both halves of the credential API:

- `CredentialCoordinator` owns storage, migration, refresh, and rejection adjudication in the
  account Durable Object.
- `CredentialSource` fetches those credentials over RPC and runs provider calls in a resource
  facet.

The `CredentialSource over a CredentialCoordinator` suite in
[`__tests__/credentials.test.ts`](__tests__/credentials.test.ts) is the executable reference.

### 1. Create the coordinator in the account Durable Object

Use the stable `ctx.storage.kv` object so refreshes coalesce across coordinator instances.
`discardMint` is deliberately absent: whether a fenced-out mint can be revoked without killing the
surviving connection is provider-specific — see "Revoke discarded token rotations" below.

```ts
#creds = new CredentialCoordinator<Grant>(this.ctx.storage.kv, {
  expiresAt: grant => grant.expiresAt,
  legacyKeys: ["accessToken", "refreshToken"],
  upgrade: kv => readLegacyGrant(kv),
  vendorId: VENDOR_ID,
});
```

`legacyKeys` is the deletion set, not only the migration input. List every key the old layout owned,
including expiry, scope, endpoint, and refresh-token keys. `clear()` deletes exactly this set, so an
omitted key leaves credential material behind after disconnect.

### 2. Expose the account RPC methods

Both methods stay thin because the coordinator owns the atomic credential, identity, and generation
triple, refresh fencing, and rejection verdicts:

```ts
#refresh = oauthRefresh<Grant>(this.#client, {
  refreshToken: grant => grant.refreshToken,
  merge: mergeOAuthTokens,
  expiredMessage: "Reconnect the Vendor account in the Workshop.",
});

async getCredentials(): Promise<CredentialsWithIdentity<PublicGrant>> {
  const { creds, identity, generation } = await this.#creds.snapshot(
    this.#refresh,
    { notify: () => this.#notify() },
  );
  return {
    creds: { token: creds.accessToken, expiresAt: creds.expiresAt },
    identity,
    generation,
  };
}

reportCredentialsRejected(identity: string) {
  return this.#creds.adjudicateRejection(identity, {
    refresh: this.#refresh,
    notify: () => this.#notify(),
  });
}

#notify() {
  const callback = this.ctx.storage.kv
    .get<Fetcher<GatekeeperConnectCallback>>("callback");
  return notifyCredentialsExpiredOnce(
    this.ctx.storage.kv,
    callback,
    VENDOR_ID,
  );
}
```

Project credentials before returning them. Refresh material must not cross the account RPC
boundary.

The refresh owns a classification the coordinator cannot make: throw `CredentialsExpiredError` only
when the provider proves the *grant* is dead. `oauthRefresh` carries that classification in its
`isGrantDeath` option, which defaults to `isInvalidGrant` — an RFC 6749 `invalid_grant` below HTTP
500, other than 429. A supplied predicate replaces that default, so widen it by composing,
`error => isInvalidGrant(error) || …`, and only for provider-specific evidence of the same, such as
a revoked refresh token reported another way. Key it on `oauthError`, not a bare status, which a
proxy or WAF page carries too. Let transport, malformed-response, and 5xx failures travel
unchanged, and never read a bare `invalid_token` as that proof: it is RFC 6750 for the presented
access token, which a refresh recovers. Treating either an outage or a recoverable token
rejection as grant death destroys healthy authority and prompts an unnecessary reconnect.

It also owes the *complete* canonical record, not the provider's response. Providers routinely omit
values that did not change — an unchanged rotating refresh token, granted scopes, provider metadata
— and the coordinator replaces the stored record wholesale, so anything absent is lost and the next
refresh fails after the first successful rotation. `mergeOAuthTokens` keeps those values but
replaces `expiresAt`, since a carried-forward past expiry would refresh on every read. A grant with
other provider-reported fields extends it, picking each field rather than spreading the response:

```ts
merge: (grant, tokens) => ({
  ...mergeOAuthTokens(grant, tokens),
  instanceUrl: typeof tokens.raw.instance_url === "string"
    ? tokens.raw.instance_url
    : grant.instanceUrl,
}),
```

Omit `adjudicateRejection`'s `refresh` callback when rejection of a current credential proves the
whole grant is dead. A heal cannot recover that provider model and would suppress the expiry
notification.

A provider-confirmed death is recorded against the grant's identity fence, so every later read —
in this facet or any other over the same storage — refuses it until a reconnect replaces it, even
while its access token is still inside its own expiry window. The grant itself stays stored, so
account-owned revoke keeps its material and a failed expiry notification can still be retried by
a later read.

Every credential replacement re-arms the expiry latch. This includes `connect()`, successful
refresh, and rejection healing. A legacy-layout migration does not re-arm it because it replaces no
credentials. `clearCredentialExpiryLatch` remains available for accounts that manage credentials
without `CredentialCoordinator`.

### 3. Run facet calls through `CredentialSource`

```ts
#creds = new CredentialSource<PublicGrant>({
  account: () => this.env.ACCOUNT.get(this.accountId),
  isAuthError: error =>
    error instanceof VendorApiError && error.status === 401,
  expiredMessage: "Reconnect the Vendor account in the Workshop.",
});

listProjects() {
  return this.#creds.run(
    grant => this.#api.listProjects(grant),
    { replayable: true },
  );
}
```

`isAuthError` classifies credential rejection only. Do not classify a per-resource 403 or 404 as an
authentication error; doing so can retire a healthy account.

Set `replayable: true` only when the operation may execute twice. Re-entry can repeat provider calls
that succeeded before a later call rejected the credential. Without that flag, stale rejection
surfaces as `CredentialsChangedError` instead.

### 4. Handle the credential errors

Handle two credential errors:

- `isCredentialsChanged(error)` means the operation used stale credentials. Re-enter a replay-safe
  operation or surface the error when replay is unsafe.
- `isCredentialsExpired(error)` means the provider proved the grant is dead. Tell the user to
  reconnect. Workshop notification was attempted separately and may have failed.

Let every other error travel unchanged, including account RPC failures. An unreachable account is
not an expired grant.

### 5. Revoke discarded token rotations

A provider that rotates refresh tokens should implement `discardMint`. A reconnect or revoke can win
while refresh is in flight, leaving the completed mint fenced out of storage. Revoke that grant at
the provider so no live credential chain remains without a stored handle.

Do this only where revoking the discarded mint cannot invalidate the grant the surviving connection
uses. RFC 7009 lets a provider treat revoking one refresh token as revoking the whole authorization
grant, so where a reconnect reuses one grant per (user, client) the disposal kills the connection
that just won. For such a provider omit `discardMint` and order refresh against connect and clear in
the account itself — the kit supplies no primitive for that.

Where it can, `discardMint` is `mint => client.revoke({ token: mint.refreshToken!, tokenTypeHint:
"refresh_token" })`. The coordinator awaits it inside the refresh single-flight, which the client's
`timeoutMs` bounds. The recipe assumes every refresh rotates. `mergeOAuthTokens` carries an
unrotated refresh token forward, so on a provider that may not rotate, the mint holds the token the
refresh started from: revoking it disposes of more than the mint, and kills a winner handed the same
token back. The mint added only a short-lived access token there, so such a provider omits
`discardMint`.

Errors from `discardMint` are logged and do not replace the winning operation. It cannot recover a
crash between provider rotation and storage; the user must reconnect in that case.

### 6. Declare each action's fence, and capture it from the operation's own read

`defineActions` requires a `fence` policy for the whole set, with `fenceOverrides` naming the kinds
that differ. It is required rather than defaulted because an omitted fence is invisible: the
gatekeeper works, its tests pass, and an action approved under one provider account later applies
under the next one.

```ts
defineActions(definitions, {
  fence: "authority",
  // Named one at a time, so opting out is always a decision someone made.
  fenceOverrides: { pingHealthEndpoint: "none" },
});
```

An `"authority"` kind must be staged with the authority the operation ran under. For the common
connection fence, that is the `CredentialRead` **the staging operation itself ran under**.
`CredentialSource.run()` passes it as the operation's second argument, and it is structurally an
`ActionFence`, so `{ fence: read }` works verbatim. `submit` refuses the call without one, and
refuses a fence on a kind declared `"none"`. The kit never interprets the value, so a provider that
wants an action to survive re-authorization of the same account stores its own stable account id
instead and passes that at apply.

The read has to be the operation's own. A second `read()` taken inside the submit path can land
after a reconnect and would pin old-connection data to the new connection — which is why the kit
cannot capture the fence for you.

Apply then compares whatever was staged, by opaque equality. For a connection fence pass
`apply(id, { generation })` from `CredentialSource.read()`; for a custom fence pass that same
stable value instead — a connection generation and an account id can never match, and an action
staged under one and applied under the other fails terminally on every attempt. That is an
entry check, so a reconnect may still land between it and the provider call. A handler that must
not run under a replaced connection compares `ctx.fence` with the `CredentialRead` passed to the
same `run` callback that issues the request.

## OAuth token endpoint

`OAuthClient` in `./oauth-client` makes the token-endpoint calls behind a connect flow and a
refresh: authorization URLs with PKCE, code exchange, refresh, and RFC 7009 revocation. Every
request refuses redirects, is bounded in time and size, and reports a rejection as
`OAuthResponseError`, whose message carries no provider text beyond a validated `error` code;
transport, abort, and oversize failures propagate unchanged. The `oauth-client with the connect
handshake and CredentialCoordinator` suite in
[`__tests__/workerd/oauth-client.test.ts`](__tests__/workerd/oauth-client.test.ts) is the
executable reference.

```ts
#client = new OAuthClient({
  label: "Vendor",
  client: { method: "basic", id: this.env.CLIENT_ID, secret: this.env.CLIENT_SECRET },
  authorizationEndpoint: "https://vendor.example/oauth/authorize",
  tokenEndpoint: "https://vendor.example/oauth/token",
});
```

- Pass `redirectUri` per call, from what the connect attempt stored. It is deliberately not client
  configuration: under `PreviewOAuth` it depends on the deployment, and the exchange must repeat the
  exact URI the authorization used.
- Pick fields explicitly. A `claimOAuth` claim also carries the nonce's own `value` and `expiresAt`,
  and `OAuthTokens.raw` is whatever the provider sent, so spreading either into a grant stores
  nonce or provider data as credentials. `OAuthTokens.expiresAt` is absolute epoch milliseconds,
  anchored at the request's start, and feeds `CredentialCoordinator`'s `expiresAt` unchanged.
- Only a refresh can prove grant death. `invalid_client`, `unauthorized_client`, `invalid_scope`,
  429, and 5xx are rethrown: with one static client they are operator or provider faults, and
  treating them as death would expire every user at once. A deleted dynamically registered client
  is the kind of evidence that justifies widening `isGrantDeath`. An `invalid_grant` answering
  `exchangeCode` is a failed connect.
- A response with no `expires_in` and a client with no `defaultExpiresIn` leave `expiresAt` absent,
  so the grant refreshes only when a rejection is adjudicated. A lifetime within the coordinator's
  `refreshSkewMs` refreshes on every read.

When a provider does not fit, step down one rung at a time:

1. `oauthRefresh` with `mergeOAuthTokens`.
2. The client's own methods, with `params`, `headers`, and `bodyEncoding`, plus
   `searchParams.append` on the returned authorization `URL` for a repeated parameter. They classify
   nothing, so the caller decides which failures prove grant death, composing `isInvalidGrant`.
3. `client.request()` with `parseTokenResponse`, for a request or response shaped outside RFC 6749
   (Slack nests user tokens under `authed_user`). `request()` reserves no parameters and does not
   require an `access_token`; the parser does.
4. A native `RefreshCredentials<Grant>`, keeping every other leaf. A non-RFC revocation, such as a
   JSON body or a `DELETE`, stays hand-written.

## Storage

### Name the narrowest surface

Each module accepts the structural KV surface it needs (`KvReadWrite`, `KvMutable`, or
`KvScannable`) instead of `DurableObjectStorage`. The signature records whether the module can read,
write, delete, or scan. It also keeps pure modules testable against a plain object.

### Pass stable storage objects

Pass the same `ctx.storage.kv` object on every access. Credential refreshes, expiry notifications,
and observer claim counts key process-local coordination by storage-object identity. Wrapping the
storage for every call defeats coalescing and can spend a single-use refresh token twice.

That identity requirement is also why the kit's stateful objects are Durable-Object-local. A
journal, gate, cache, coordinator, source, or tracker is built inside the object that owns its
storage and never crosses an RPC boundary — attempting it fails with `DataCloneError`. Expose RPC
methods instead, and return either plain data or a cursor: `ArrayCursor` and the provider-backed
cursors extend `RpcTarget` precisely because they are the one kit type meant to be handed out.

### Name every keyspace

`ActionJournal` takes a `namespace` and `KvTtlCache` a `name`; both derive every key from it. Two
journals sharing a keyspace share ids and capacity while each bound action set serializes apply and
reject on its own in-memory queue, so nothing orders their provider calls against each other. Two
caches sharing one serve each other's values for colliding keys, and either one's `invalidateAll()`
clears both.

### Treat storage layout as compatibility

Shipped key names and prefixes are compatibility surfaces. Renaming one silently orphans live
records. A port that must keep reading records it already wrote passes `legacyKeys` (journal) or
`legacyUnnamed` (cache) instead of a namespace — mutually exclusive with it, so the unsafe shared
layout is always an explicit choice. `ObserverTrackerOptions` has its own key options for the same
reason.

### Fake the surface, not the runtime

A Node test double can be a small object implementing the required KV methods. Transactional tests
can add the synchronous transaction surface:

```ts
const storage = {
  kv,
  transactionSync<T>(callback: () => T): T {
    return callback();
  },
};
```

Persisted RPC stubs, `RpcTarget` behavior, and `crypto.subtle.timingSafeEqual` need workerd tests.
Those suites live under [`__tests__/workerd/`](__tests__/workerd/) and load
`@gadgets/scripts/assert-workerd`, so a failed Workers pool cannot pass silently in Node.

## Caching

Give each `KvTtlCache` a `name`, which gives it its own keys and generation.

`partitionedBy` asks the source for a live connection fence on every hit, so a reconnect
repartitions before the next hit rather than at the next provider call. That costs one account
credential read per hit — which may itself run a normal credential refresh — and still avoids the
provider request the entry exists to cache. A disconnected account propagates its own error; a
source that cannot vouch for the credentials bypasses the cache. Compose an authority on the raw
constructor only where it is genuinely local.

## Actions and files

Use `defineActions` and `stageAction` for externally visible side effects. They own the
submit, approve, apply, and retire lifecycle, including retryable versus terminal failure,
dependency stranding, and connection fences.

`retainApplied: true` opts out of retirement: applied records move to a retained tier the kit never
bounds. Enforce the binding's retention policy inside `runExclusive()`: walk storage-bounded pages
with `journal.listRetained({ limit, cursor })`, pass each `nextCursor` back until it is absent, and
call `journal.retire(id)` for each expired record.

An apply failure has three outcomes, and the handler picks by what it throws. An ordinary error is
retryable: the record returns to pending and the overseer may apply it again, so use it only when a
second attempt is safe. `ActionApplyError` is terminal and asserts the provider effect is **known
absent** — it retires the dependents waiting on references this action was to provide.
`ActionOutcomeUnknownError` is terminal and asserts nothing: use it for a timeout, an aborted
request, or any failure after the provider was reached. That record is never replayed and never
pruned, strands no dependent, and holds a slot until the user rejects it, so the "check the
provider" warning survives.

`claimBeforeApply` produces that same unknown outcome when an activation dies mid-dispatch. Neither
substitutes for a provider idempotency key derived from the stable `ActionContext.id`, which is
what makes a retry safe in the first place.

### Describe with `buildDescription`

Write `describe` with `buildDescription` from `@gadgets/gatekeeper-kit/action-description`. The
approver vouches for the text they read, so every piece of content the action will send that came
from the workspace — a body, a field value, an identifier, serialized arguments — goes in a field
(`inline`, `verbatim`, `json`, `list`, or `file`). Fields travel as `ActionDescription.fields`,
which approval surfaces show as literal text, so nothing in a value renders as Markdown. A value a
field cannot show exactly, such as one with invisible characters, is shown as escaped JSON instead.
Prose is for the gatekeeper's own summary: never interpolate agent- or provider-supplied text into
it, since such text can open an HTML block the chat hides. Put the value in a field, or pass a mere
label through `codeSpan` or `plainInline`. Spread `finish()` into the presentation and never set
`descriptionIsComplete` by hand: the builder sets it only when every field was shown in full under
its 96 KiB budget, and leaves the key off after truncating or omitting one, or when prose alone
overflows it. An incomplete description is still submitted, and the approver is told part of the
action isn't shown.

```ts
describe: payload => ({
  title: `Comment on issue ${payload.issueId}`,
  ...buildDescription("Posts a comment on an issue.")
    .inline("Issue", payload.issueId)
    .verbatim("Comment", payload.body)
    .finish(),
  implementsRevert: false,
}),
```

Bytes the approver cannot read as text — an agent-supplied file, git objects — cannot be complete.
Name a file with `file(label, {name, mediaType, size, sha256, origin})`: `origin: "agent"` leaves
the flag off, while `origin: "provider"`, for bytes re-sent unchanged from the same provider such as
a forwarded attachment, keeps it on.

Store action file bytes with `ActionFileStore`. Put only the bounded `ActionFileReference` in the
action payload. Journal records must stay small, and approval text must describe the same bytes that
will be applied.

Release those bytes yourself — the kit never collects them, and every capture counts against
`maxTotalBytes` until it is deleted. Call `delete(reference)` when the action's record goes away:
on resolution normally, but only when `journal.retire(id)` removes an expired retained record under
`retainApplied: true`, since that record is what a revert reads back. Sweep orphans with
`pruneUnreferenced(referenced, createdBefore)`
before a new capture, passing every handle your pending **and retained** records name, plus a cutoff
old enough to spare a capture whose submission is still in flight. An orphan outlives a rejected
action, a terminal failure, and a capture whose `submit` never landed; without a sweep they
accumulate until the cap refuses every new file-backed action.

A declaration using `delivery: "continue-with-simulation"` must project pending actions onto later
reads. Use `createSimulationView`, `replaySimulation`, and `ProvisionalIds` for that projection and
for mapping provisional IDs to provider IDs.

## Observations

Every session method that returns provider data must await `ObservationGate.authorize()` before it
returns, in this order: fetch, authorize, return.

```ts
async getPage(id: string) {
  const page = await this.#api.page(id);
  const title = escapeObservationValue(page.title);
  await this.#gate.authorize(
    { title: `Page: ${title}`, description: `Read page **${title}**.` },
    { kind: "collections", ids: [page.spaceId] },
  );
  return project(page);
}
```

Run every provider-controlled string through `escapeObservationValue()` first. It collapses
newlines and escapes Markdown controls, so a page whose title carries `#` or a line break cannot
forge structure in the text a human approves against.

Nothing in the kit can enforce this — no code sits between a session method and its return value.
Skipping it fails silently: reads keep working, the Workshop records no observation, and the
strategy's derived `excludeObservers` never reaches the overseer, so owner-only data goes to every
admitted collaborator. Authorizing after the fetch makes the description name the bytes actually
disclosed; authorizing before it would describe a read that may still fail.

`ObservationGate` is the only path to `authorizeObservation`. It takes a duplicate of the stub it
guards and owns that dup, so a session holds two owners — its own approval queue for staging
actions, and the gate over `queue.dup()` — and releases both when the session ends:

```ts
#queue = queue;
#gate = new ObservationGate(queue.dup(), this.#observers);

[Symbol.dispose]() {
  this.#gate[Symbol.dispose]();
  this.#queue[Symbol.dispose]();
}
```

The gate only needs `ObservationAuthorizer`, the read-only capability, so a slash-command
handler — which receives exactly that — constructs one from its own `authorizer.dup()`. Gate
leases (`lease()`) are independent owners in the same way.

Every gatekeeper must implement the three observer methods, and `GatekeeperUser.getVerifier()`
alongside them. `aclObservers` and `trackedCollectionObservers` call that capability to check a
collaborator, and `asVerifier` casts it to the vendor's own interface. Select one strategy:

- `privateObservers` rejects collaborators.
- `aclObservers` checks baseline resource access when a collaborator is admitted.
- `trackedCollectionObservers` tracks disclosed collections and rechecks each observer for every collection-scoped read.
- `openObservers` admits every observer without consulting the provider. Choose it only where the
  data carries no provider-side access distinction, since a collaborator the provider itself would
  refuse still observes everything the binding reads.

`trackedCollectionObservers` persists verifier stubs. Its Worker needs the
`allow_irrevocable_stub_storage` compatibility flag; without it, the first `addObserver` fails with
`DataCloneError`.

### Baseline access is checked at admission

`verifyBaseline` and `aclObservers.hasAccess` run when a collaborator is admitted. The overseer
re-admits on every open, so losing Workshop membership is the revocation path.

Only `trackedCollectionObservers` continuously runs its oracle. It calls `hasCollectionAccess` for every observer
on every collection-scoped read. If the provider can revoke binding-level access independently of Workshop
membership, a `{ kind: "baseline" }` read is insufficient because it consults no oracle. Represent
that disclosure with a synthetic collection ID instead.

### Scope describes the disclosure

`ObservationScope` describes what a read reveals: `baseline`, `collections`, or `withholdFromObservers`.

A **collection** is a provider-side access-controlled grouping — a Confluence space, a Jira project, a
GitHub repo — whose ACL governs the items the read returned. Pass the ids of those groupings, not
of the individual rows.

Each strategy declares, as `aclChecks`, how thoroughly it verifies observer access to them, and the
gate refuses a `collections` scope a strategy cannot honour:

| Strategy | `aclChecks` | A `collections` scope |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `trackedCollectionObservers` | `per-read` | checked for every observer, on every read |
| `privateObservers` | `no-observers` | accepted; nobody is admitted to exclude |
| `aclObservers` | `unsupported` | **refused** |
| `openObservers` | `unsupported` | **refused** |

A resource whose children carry their own ACLs needs `trackedCollectionObservers`. Under the other two,
collection ids would name a check nothing performs, so declare those reads `{ kind: "baseline" }` — and if
the provider can revoke child access independently, that is the wrong strategy, not the wrong
scope. A custom strategy declares its own `aclChecks`, and only the `per-read` arm may carry
`prepare`, so claiming a check it does not implement will not compile.

### A cursor authorizes everything it hands out

A provider-backed cursor returns provider data from `next()`, so it carries the same obligation. The
session cannot discharge it up front: the pages do not exist yet, and one `next()` may be served
from the buffer with no provider fetch at all. Pass `authorizePage`, which the cursor calls with the
exact page it is about to return:

```ts
// A cursor is walked after this call returns, so it takes its own gate with `lease()` and
// releases it from `dispose`. Built on the session's gate instead, the first `next()` after the
// session releases its stub fails on the authorization rather than the data.
const walk = this.#gate.lease();
return new TokenCursor<Project>({
  pageSize: 50,
  dispose: () => walk[Symbol.dispose](),
  fetchPage: (token, perPage) => this.#api.listProjects({ cursor: token, limit: perPage }),
  authorizePage: (projects, { terminal }) => projects.length === 0
    ? walk.authorize(
      {
        title: "Projects",
        description: terminal
          ? "Listed the projects; there were none."
          : "Scanned a window of projects; none were visible.",
      },
      { kind: "baseline" })
    : walk.authorize(
      { title: "Projects", description: `Read ${projects.length} projects.` },
      { kind: "collections", ids: projects.map(project => project.id) }),
});
```

The lease and the session gate share the binding's strategy, so exclusions stay one decision; only
the stub is duplicated, and either side can be released without disturbing the other. `lease()`
needs a real `RpcStub` — the overseer hands one over, but a gate built from a service binding
cannot duplicate it, since `dup` is reserved over RPC.

Every page is authorized, including an empty one from a spent fetch window. So is the end of a walk
that disclosed nothing: `searchUsers(email) → no matches` answers a question about provider data,
and letting that reach the gadget unaudited turns the cursor into an existence oracle. A walk that
already returned a page does not re-authorize its `null`, and exhaustion is authorized at most once.

Branch on `projects.length`, not on `terminal`. Both an exhausted walk and a spent mid-walk window
arrive with no items, and `{ kind: "collections", ids: [] }` is refused — naming no collection is exactly the
shape the gate rejects. `terminal` distinguishes the two only for the description: whether the walk
is over, or the caller should ask again. The `collections` branch above also assumes
`trackedCollectionObservers`; under a strategy whose `aclChecks` is `"unsupported"` every branch is
`baseline`, per the table above.

A refusal holds the outgoing page, so the retry re-offers exactly it with no further provider
fetch: a page the provider capped short cannot grow between the refusal and the retry, which would
hand the approver something larger than what they refused. An empty page from a spent window is the
exception — nothing was disclosed, so the retry opens a fresh window rather than pinning the walk
on a failure that may have been transient. A refused zero-result answer is likewise re-offered.
`ArrayCursor` takes no callback: the session that assembled its items authorized them as one read.

That hold is also why a walk pinned to a connection must re-check its authority in
`authorizePage`, not only in `fetchPage`. The retry never re-enters the fetch, so a reconnect
landing between the refusal and the retry would otherwise disclose the previous connection's rows
under the new one. Compare against a read taken now — a value captured earlier names the
connection the walk opened under, not the current one:

```ts
const opened = await this.#creds.read();
return new TokenCursor<Project>({
  authorizePage: async projects => {
    if ((await this.#creds.read()).generation !== opened.generation) {
      throw new Error("This walk was started under a connection that has since been replaced.");
    }
    await walk.authorize(/* … */);
  },
  // …
});
```

### Refusal and failure have different outcomes

`ObservationGate.authorize()` reclaims prepared state only when an error carries
`OBSERVATION_REFUSED_CODE`. That mark proves the overseer refused the observation before recording
anything.

Every other failure has an unknown outcome. The gate releases in-memory bookkeeping but retains
durable fences because a lost reply may have left an observation record. A tracked-collection marker is
reclaimed only after every read that disclosed the collection was refused. One unknown result retains it.

The Workshop overseer does not yet add this code: both pre-recording refusal paths — owner-only
observations in shared workspaces, and collaborator exclusions — still throw plain errors. Until a
kernel change marks them, every failure takes the fail-closed unknown-outcome path above, and
`discard()` never runs. For a `withholdFromObservers` read that is not merely a retained marker:
`abandon` latches the binding unshareable for good, so a refused owner-only read costs the
workspace its sharing until the kernel distinguishes the two.

## Bounds

Every cap must be a positive safe integer. Constructors reject zero, fractional, and unsafe values
instead of allowing a bound to disable itself.

The kit supplies defaults where they apply across consumers:

| Option | Default |
| --- | ---: |
| `maxPending` | 50 |
| `maxTrackedCollections` | 1000 |
| `maxObservers` | 10 |
| `remotePageSize` | 100 |
| `OAuthClient` `timeoutMs` | 30 000 ms |
| `OAuthClient` `maxResponseBytes` | 64 KiB |

The kit requires values where no general default is safe:

- Every cursor's `pageSize`.
- `ActionFileStore`'s `maxFileBytes` and `maxTotalBytes`.

Size limits from the provider and the disclosure shape. `maxTrackedCollections` is a cumulative budget: it
bounds the distinct collections this binding has *ever* disclosed, including markers a fail-closed read
left behind, so size it from the whole resource rather than one page — a per-page value starts
refusing valid reads once later pages reveal new collections. `maxObservers` must account for the Workers
subrequest ceiling because every observer costs a verifier call on each read. `remotePageSize`
cannot exceed the provider's page cap.

## Git

`git-transport`, `git-objects`, and `git-diff` implement the worktree contract in
`plans/worktrees.md` §3 for any smart-HTTP host. The gatekeeper supplies a fetch callback that adds
the URL, credentials, and timeouts; the kit owns the framing. Two rules of the framing are easy to
break from the outside and fail late when broken:

- **Never send a `have`.** A `have` asserts full reachability of that commit, but every pull here
  is filtered or shallow, so the workspace cache holds commits whose blobs or ancestors it lacks.
  Sending one makes upload-pack withhold objects a later fault will `want`. `buildGitFetchRequest`
  sends an empty have list and `done`; do not build a fetch request another way to "save bytes".
- **At most one `filter` line.** upload-pack accepts a single filter-spec — a second `filter` line
  is not merged, and GitHub rejects the request outright. Combining hints is spelled in the
  filter-spec grammar or not at all; `filterSpecForHints` is the one place that chooses, and its
  limits are documented on it (`blob:limit` and `tree:0` are known to work on GitHub; `combine:`
  is not).

Every ref update goes through `pushGitRefUpdate` with the *queue-time* old sha, so receive-pack's
compare-and-swap protects a branch that moved between approval and apply; a rejected update is a
`GitRefUpdateRejectedError` whose `reason` is the server's own line, which the gatekeeper passes
through rather than matching on. Advertise every commit id a read hands out — `advertiseCommits`
for a single read, and for a listing a `PageHookCursor` whose hook is `advertisePages` — except
those served from the cache while queued for push, which both take as `withhold`: advertising one
of those would record a pull-routing hint for an object the remote does not have. A session's
`SessionGitCache` (`./cursors`) does both over its own lazily fetched cache stub, with `withhold`
given once at construction.

## Other module boundaries

- Use `withAuthRetry` only for token flows without `CredentialSource`. Otherwise,
  `CredentialSource.run()` owns refresh, replay, and expiry reporting.
- Use `isNoAccessError` or `probeAccess` for observer ACL checks. Do not use `isNoAccessError` as
  `CredentialSource.isAuthError`; it accepts 403 and 404.
- Use `readTextCapped` for every textual, JSON, or error body — a provider can return more bytes
  than the Worker can hold — and for a connect form read before its nonce is checked. It decodes
  UTF-8 and buffers, so binary downloads and streaming protocols (SSE, Git) need their own
  byte-preserving limit instead.
- Use `normalizeVendorEndpoint` for user-supplied provider base URLs. It validates that one URL and
  is not a fetch policy: fetch with `redirect: "manual"`, or re-validate each `Location` and drop
  origin-scoped headers when the origin changes, or a redirect carries `Authorization` off the
  allowlisted host.
- Use `PreviewOAuth` when previews must share one stable callback registered with the OAuth
  provider.
- Use `OAuthClient` for OAuth 2.0 token-endpoint calls rather than a hand-written `fetch`. It is
  stateless and classifies nothing as grant death on its own, so a refresh still goes through
  `CredentialCoordinator` via `oauthRefresh`, and the two modules share no state with
  `PreviewOAuth`.
- Every callback the kit invokes must throw display-safe errors. `discardMint`, the rejection heal,
  and the expiry notification all log what they catch, so a thrown token, header, or response body
  lands in the deployment's logs.
