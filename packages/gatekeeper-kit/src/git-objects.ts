// Pure git-object helpers behind a gatekeeper's git read APIs: commit-id validation, raw
// commit-object parsing (for simulating reads of commits that are queued for push but not yet on
// the remote, from their exact local bytes), and the commit-id advertising machinery that reports
// every returned commit id to the workspace git cache (`GitCache.advertiseCommit()`), so the
// overseer knows this gatekeeper's remote can supply those commits when one is later mounted as a
// worktree.
//
// Provider-neutral by construction: nothing here knows a REST response shape. A gatekeeper's own
// `normalize*` adapters map its provider's JSON onto its agent-facing types; this module covers
// what is the same for every git host.
//
// This module deliberately has no runtime imports (in particular no `cloudflare:workers`), so its
// logic runs under the kit's Node vitest project. A listing hands `advertisePages()`'s hook to the
// kit's `PageHookCursor` (`./cursors`), the `RpcTarget` that runs it on each page before the
// caller sees it.
