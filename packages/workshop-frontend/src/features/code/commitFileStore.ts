// The per-commit file store behind the code view: the client-side cache of Overseer.listTree(),
// Overseer.readFilesAtCommit() and Overseer.listChangedPaths(). Commits are immutable, so
// everything here is memoized by commit id for the page's lifetime -- across chat switches,
// workpiece switches, and component remounts -- and a base an editor already opened is never
// fetched twice, including by the OT client, whose delegate reads through the same store.
// Failures are evicted so a later attempt retries.
//
// Reads are coalesced: every readFiles() call made in one microtask turn for the same commit
// joins a single RPC (chunked at MAX_READ_FILES_PER_CALL), so a view that asks for a file's
// content, its review-base original, and the statuses of a dozen touched paths in one render
// pays one round trip. Paths the server omitted under its response byte budget are re-requested
// until every requested path has an answer (the server always returns at least one entry per
// non-empty request, so the loop terminates).
