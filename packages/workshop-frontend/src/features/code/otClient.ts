// The chat-level OT client: the classic two-buffer client behind the code view.
//
// A chat's uncommitted code is one revisioned stream of code changes per generation (see
// ChatCodeBase in the API). This client tracks that stream for one chat: it derives the chat's
// content (the epoch's materialized changes + accepted rows, over per-pin base commits), holds
// at most one in-flight submitCodeChange() plus one pending composition of newer local edits,
// transforms both over incoming remote rows (the priority pairing lives in code-change.ts), and
// rebases them. The pending buffer *composes*, so submissions land at ~RTT granularity --
// everything typed since the last ack rides one submit -- not per keystroke.
//
// Content is *sparse*: a pinned workpiece's entry holds only the paths the epoch has touched
// (plus paths the user began editing), never its base tree. `set` and `remove` rows need no
// base; an `edit` of a path not yet held seeds exactly that path from the pin's base commit
// before applying. A per-workpiece tombstone set records removals (a `remove` adds, a `set`
// clears), since applyCodeChange deletes the key. So "touched" is "in getFiles() or in
// getRemovedPaths()", and everything untouched is read by the view from the base commit
// directly (see commitFileStore) -- the same way for a gadget and a worktree.
//
// Inputs arrive through three paths, each safe to deliver redundantly or out of order across
// paths (the client holds rows it cannot apply yet and drains them as knowledge arrives):
//  - setDurableState(): the chat's ChatCodeBase plus the composed change of the current epoch's
//    "changes" messages (see ChatCodeChanges in ChatInterface). Also how generation bumps are
//    learned: a content-preserving bump (a merge's epoch reset, `prior` present) hands the
//    local buffers across the boundary, so typing straight through someone's accept is
//    seamless; a destructive bump (revert / draft discard / turn abort) discards local edits
//    and rebuilds, per ChatCodeBase.generation's contract.
//  - pushRow(): one AiChatSubscriber.changeApplied() row. Deduped by (generation, revision), so
//    subscribe-replay after a reconnect is harmless.
//  - applyLocalChange() (with ensureFileEditable() first for a path the content doesn't hold):
//    locally-authored edits, composed into the pending buffer and submitted under the
//    client-generated (clientId, seq) idempotency scheme of Overseer.submitCodeChange().
//
// Base content is never taken from another client: it always comes from
// readFilesAtCommit(baseCommit, paths) (the delegate's fetch, cacheable by oid) or, for the
// first local edit to an unpinned workpiece, from the base text the view is already displaying
// -- which is byte-identical to what the accompanying pin declaration names. The client mints a
// fresh clientId whenever local state is rebuilt; a transport failure retries the same seq with
// an identical payload, never a re-composed change (the server's dedupe digest requires it).
