// The code view over a workpiece's git-backed files -- a gadget's code or a worktree's checkout.
// The two differ here in exactly two places: which summary field names the *accepted commit*
// (a gadget's `commitId`, a worktree's `pinBase`; see acceptedCommitOf), and what the workpiece
// is called in copy. Everything else is one code path.
//
// Committed content is git commits, read lazily through the per-commit file store (see
// commitFileStore.ts): Overseer.listTree() for a commit's tree, Overseer.readFilesAtCommit()
// for content by path, both immutable and cached by oid. Two commits matter here and are kept
// apart:
//  - The *content base* is what the chat's content is built on: the chat pin's base commit when
//    the workpiece is pinned in the selected chat, else the accepted commit. The tree, an
//    untouched file's text, and the seed for a local edit all come from it -- what the agent
//    reads.
//  - The *review base* is what "changed" means: the diff's original side and the statuses are
//    computed against it. It is the pin's `mergedCommit` -- the mainline commit whose content
//    has been merged into the chat -- else the accepted commit. That is exactly what accepting
//    would apply: a chat not updated from mainline diffs against its pin, so mainline's later
//    commits never show up (accepting doesn't revert them, it is blocked until they are merged
//    in). Once updateChatFromMainline has merged them, the pin is rooted at the merge commit
//    and `mergedCommit` is the head it merged, so what mainline changed compares equal and
//    vanishes, rather than being listed as this chat's own changes. Accept requires
//    `mergedCommit === head`, so where it is enabled the two agree.
// The two coincide except for a gadget chat whose pin is rooted at a merge: one updated from
// mainline, or made by applying a blueprint. The paths where they differ are listed by
// Overseer.listChangedPaths(), which is how a file that only the merge changed reaches the
// Changes list though the chat's content never touched it. For a worktree
// they always coincide (it has no mainline), and in particular the worktree's own `headCommit`
// -- the agent's last explicit commit -- plays no role: an agent that edits and immediately
// commits still shows its work against the last *accepted* commit.
//
// A chat's uncommitted changes are a revisioned stream of code changes (see ChatCodeBase in the
// API), tracked here by a per-chat ChatOtClient (see otClient.ts). Its content is sparse: for
// a pinned workpiece it holds only the paths the epoch touched (plus tombstones for removals),
// so "touched" is exactly "in the client's files or removed paths", and the view reads
// everything else from the content base. The user's edits are composed locally and submitted
// through Overseer.submitCodeChange().
//
// A workpiece not pinned in the chat tracks its accepted commit live. The user can start editing
// it without any extra round trip: the editor shows the base text the store already loaded, and
// the first local edit seeds the client with just that path's base text and declares the pin
// on its next submission (the first-keystroke pin flow; see ChatOtClient.ensureFileEditable).
// If the server refuses a submission -- the chat's generation moved destructively under a
// revert/draft-discard, or the pin declaration lost a race -- the queued local edits are
// discarded with a notice and the view rebuilds from server state, per
// ChatCodeBase.generation's contract. Merges don't discard anything: the client rides the
// epoch reset (and the server's straggler bridge) seamlessly.
//
// There is no standalone (out-of-chat) editing: accepted commits only advance when a chat's
// changes are accepted.
