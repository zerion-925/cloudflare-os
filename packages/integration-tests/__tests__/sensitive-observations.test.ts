// Tests for the sensitive-data (`containsRestrictedData`) observation policy.
//
// Coverage is enforced at admission, not at the read: every collaborator passes the producing
// gatekeeper's `addObserver` at their most recent open and cannot open without passing it, and
// anything that widens what they must pass restarts the workspace so every live session re-opens
// against the new scope. So sensitive observations are not blocked by an unverified collaborator,
// and sharing stays available. The observation also sets `containsRestrictedData`, putting the
// workspace into a restricted mode: once it is set, every action pends for manual approval and is
// never auto-approved, a git push is refused, and the workspace may not fetch from the web
// (covered by workshop-restricted-web-fetch.test.ts). An observation that also carries
// `ownerInvitesOnly` sets that flag too: from then on only direct grants from the owner count, so
// share links stop admitting anyone and people who joined through one lose access.
//
// The fixture gatekeeper's session drives all of this through the real ApprovalQueue funnel:
// `readValue(true)` records a `containsRestrictedData` observation, `writeValue()` submits an
// action (held for the owner's approval, so a test that wants it to go through approves it via
// the overseer).
