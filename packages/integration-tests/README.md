# integration-tests

End-to-end tests that drive the real Workshop and a real gatekeeper over the actual RPC API, plus the
toolkit those tests are built from. Part of `pnpm test`, so CI runs it like any other package.

```bash
pnpm --filter @gadgets/integration-tests test:run
```

## The toolkit

Three source-only modules, consumed both by the tests here and by per-vendor suites in repos that
vendor this one as a submodule:

- **`src/harness.ts`** — boots `workshop-backend` and any set of gatekeepers as real Workers under
  [`wrangler`'s `createTestHarness()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/changelog/post/2026-07-21-integration-test-harness/),
  patching their checked-in `wrangler.jsonc` in memory. Parameterised over gatekeepers on purpose: a
  suite for a new gatekeeper should be "point the harness at the package", not a forked copy.
  `Harness.redeployWorkshop()` deploys another build of the Workshop over the running one, keeping
  its storage, and `bundleBlueprints()` is a patch that changes which blueprints a build ships with.
- **`src/network-interceptor.ts`** — `NetworkInterceptor`, mechanism only. It patches
  `globalThis.fetch` (the harness routes Worker subrequests back through the Node process, so that is
  enough), passes loopback through, and **throws on anything a handler didn't match** — a test cannot
  reach the real internet. What a given vendor's endpoints answer lives in a handler module you pass
  in, which is what makes it reusable across gatekeepers.
- **`src/rpc-client.ts`** — speaks Cap'n Web over a WebSocket to `/api`, the same transport the
  browser uses: sign-up, reading connected accounts, and `ObserverConfigRecorder`, which records the
  overseer's `configure()` calls and answers from a scripted queue.

## Writing a test here
- **No test may assume a clean slate.** Everything in a file shares one harness, `it.concurrent` runs
  the cases together, and storage is never reset. Take fresh identities from `nextUsernames()` and use
  per-test resource URLs; account labels are allocated for you, so two tests can't pick the same one.
- **The escape assertion lives in `afterAll`, not `afterEach`** — an `afterEach` fires while sibling
  tests are still running, so it would inspect and clear state they are still using.
- **A test that redeploys the Workshop starts a harness of its own.** A redeploy restarts the Workers
  under every session they have, which would break the tests sharing the file's harness.

## The fixture gatekeeper

`fixtures/gatekeeper-test/` is a real Worker speaking the real gatekeeper protocol, whose verification
outcome the tests set over an HTTP control route. It exists because the overseer cases need a
gatekeeper that will refuse an observer *on command*, and every shipping one can do that only at a
cost that would dominate the test:

- The OAuth ones need a whole vendor auth surface mocked before an account exists at all.
- The Context Library only refuses after an observation has been *recorded*, which takes a gadget read
  session or a slash command — and it is a singleton, so it cannot produce two simultaneously failing
  bindings.

Adding a test hook to those workers was considered and rejected: a "mark observed" hook would stub the
very state the tracker maintains, and an injected dev credential for an OAuth gatekeeper would bypass
exactly the flow that makes a real vendor worth testing.

One deliberate departure from a shipping gatekeeper, to keep the fixture cheap:

- One control knob, `allow`. A settled denial and an expired credential reach the overseer identically
  — both as a thrown error, which it deliberately cannot tell apart because it treats every failure as
  repairable — so the reason string is what carries the difference. Tests cover both narratives by
  choosing reason text.

## Further reading

[`docs/integration-testing.md`](../../docs/integration-testing.md) covers the reasoning behind the
shape of all this: why fake timers cannot work here, why a fixture gatekeeper rather than a real one,
how storage isolation works, and the capnweb, wrangler, and workerd traps to expect. Read it before
changing the toolkit or starting a suite of your own.
