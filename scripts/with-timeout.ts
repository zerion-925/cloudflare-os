//
// It exists because nothing else in the test stack bounds a wedged run. Vite+ has no task timeout
// (`vp run --help` offers only concurrency flags, and `timeout` appears nowhere in its docs), and
// vitest's `testTimeout`/`hookTimeout` are enforced *inside* the test worker, so they die with it;
// the one process-level watchdog, `teardownTimeout`, is armed after the run resolves and therefore
// never arms when the run is what hangs. Underneath that,
// `@cloudflare/vitest-pool-workers` imports Miniflare without passing `onWorkerdCrashRestart`, so a
// workerd that dies mid-run leaves the pool awaiting a reply that will never arrive. The result is
// an unbounded local hang, and in CI an anonymous job-level kill that names no culprit.
//
// Silence is the primary detector rather than wall-clock: a healthy `vitest run` prints a line per
// completed test file, and a wedged one goes quiet. The total cap is the backstop for a command
// that stays chatty while looping forever.
//
// It runs as two processes. When a task fails, vp's fast-fail SIGKILLs the direct child of every
// other running task; were that child the watchdog, its tree would run on unbounded, and on Linux
// vp waits for it with no timeout. So the process vp spawns is a front that re-runs this file with
// `--lifeline` as the watchdog (the back, `supervise`), holding an IPC channel to it, and the back
// kills the tree when that channel drops, however the front died. The back stays the command's
// output reader, since an orphaned vitest dies on its first write to a dead pipe and its forks
// escape the tree walk. The front forwards no signal: Ctrl-C already reaches the back and the tree,
// and a second copy would cut the grace period short.
//
// Exit codes: 124 when a threshold fired (GNU `timeout`'s, and distinct from any vitest code), the
// child's own code otherwise, or `128 + signal` when the child or this wrapper was signalled.
//
// `TESTS_WITH_TIMEOUT_DISABLE=<anything>` switches both watchdogs off, leaving the stdio piping
// and signal relay: for a CI whose job-level timeout already bounds a wedge, or a deliberately
// unsupervised local run. A wedge is then killed anonymously by whatever is outside, with no
// surviving-tree listing to name the culprit. Under vp the variable reaches a cached task only
// through the task's `env` declaration (see vitest-task-vite-config.ts), which also fingerprints it.
