// Generates a `wrangler.staging.jsonc` next to every deployable package's `wrangler.jsonc`,
// describing that worker as it runs in a per-PR **Worker Preview**. The generated files are
// gitignored (.gitignore) — they are build output, regenerated on every `preview.ts`
// invocation.
//
// This is the preview-side counterpart of scripts/release/manifest-lib.ts: same 18 deployable
// packages, same binding topology, but resolved to concrete staging values instead of the
// manifest's `$PLACEHOLDER` templates. Where the deploy service would substitute
// `$PUBLIC_BASE_URL`, a preview substitutes the router preview's workers.dev URL.
//
// Each worker's config has two halves:
//   - the top level, which describes the *baseline* worker (`wrangler deploy`). Worker Previews
//     are branches of a baseline worker, so one must exist before a preview can be created;
//     preview.ts deploys it on demand the first time (see its isMissingWorkerError self-heal).
//   - the `previews` block, which describes the per-preview overrides (`wrangler preview`).
//     This is where resources are declared *binding-only* so Wrangler provisions a fresh KV
//     namespace / R2 bucket per preview, and where service bindings get patched to point at
//     sibling previews rather than the baselines.
//
// Gatekeeper OAuth app credentials (CLIENT_ID/CLIENT_SECRET) are absent from the generated configs
// for the same reason the backend's secrets are — Wrangler prints what it finds in one, and this
// workflow's logs are public. Where an OAuth app is configured for previews, preview.ts uploads the
// pair to that gatekeeper's Preview base config instead; see resolveGatekeeperSecrets.

/**
 * The OAuth app credentials a gatekeeper's previews are given, as `package name -> secrets`.
 *
 * Optional, per gatekeeper: an unconfigured one still deploys, and only that connector is dead in
 * the preview — unlike {@link resolveAccess}, whose absence changes how the whole instance
 * authenticates. Most gatekeepers have no preview OAuth app at all, which is why previews are for
 * routing, auth and the agent first and third-party flows only where someone registered one.
 *
 * Registering one is not just a pair of secrets. A preview's redirect URI is
 * `https://<preview>-router.<workers.dev subdomain>/gatekeeper/<short>/oauth`, and the host changes
 * with every pull request — so the app's callback URL has to be
 * `https://<workers.dev subdomain>/gatekeeper/<short>/oauth` with GitHub's wildcard matching left
 * on, which is what lets each preview's subdomain validate against it. That also means any worker
 * on that subdomain can receive an authorization code for this app, so the app it belongs to should
 * be a throwaway registered for previews and never the one a real deployment uses.
 *
 * `PREVIEW_`-prefixed rather than the `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` run-dev-server.ts reads from a developer's
 * shell: GitHub refuses to store a repository secret whose name begins with `GITHUB_`, and the
 * distinct name keeps the preview app and a maintainer's local app from being confused for one
 * another.
 *
 * Adding a second gatekeeper is a parameter pair here, one `addOAuthApp` line, the matching pair in
 * .github/workflows/preview.yml, and an entry in env-passthrough.test.ts.
 *
 * The environment is read in the parameter defaults rather than the body so that
 * env-passthrough.test.ts, whose discovery is textual, can see every name.
