// Deployment runs in three tiers, because each tier's service bindings must name the previews the
// tier before it produced:
//
//   1. the 16 gatekeepers  (concurrently; nothing binds to anything)
//   2. workshop-backend    (binds every gatekeeper preview via GatekeeperVendor)
//   3. router              (binds the backend preview and every gatekeeper preview, and owns the
//                           public origin: it serves the frontend and proxies /api and
//                           /gatekeeper/<short>)
//
// Between tiers the next tier's `previews.services[].preview_id` is patched with the ids the
// previous tier returned. Everything else — every URL in the config — is derived up front from
// the router's preview name, which is deterministic, so the tiers only have to exchange ids.
//
// The router is the only one of the eighteen with a hostname. Preview URLs are public, so the
// other seventeen set `preview_urls: false` and are reached over service bindings alone; the
// deploy asserts that, since a URL appearing on one of them is a way around the router.
//
// Secrets — the backend's admins and the Cloudflare Access application that authenticates the
// instance, and each gatekeeper's OAuth app credentials where one is configured for previews — are
// uploaded to the owning worker's Preview base config just before that worker's own tier, and are
// never written into a config, because Wrangler prints config values and this workflow's logs are
// public. See uploadSecrets, and backendSecrets / resolveGatekeeperSecrets in staging-config.ts.
