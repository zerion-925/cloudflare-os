#!/usr/bin/env node

// `node scripts/vp/run.ts <args…>` is `vp run <args…>` with `VP_RUN_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT` set from the
// machine, and `VITEST_MAX_WORKERS` from that (see concurrency.ts). The root `build`, `test` and
// `clean` scripts go through it.
//
// Spawns `node_modules/vite-plus/bin/vp` under the current `node` directly: `vite-plus` is a root
// devDependency, so it is always there, and this is shell-free (Windows-safe) and skips the ~0.33s of
// `pnpm exec` startup the repo avoids elsewhere (bin-entry.ts). `resolveBinEntry` can't be used for
// it because it keys the `bin` map on the package name, and `vite-plus`'s has no `vite-plus` entry.
//
// Arguments are forwarded verbatim -- they are inspected only for flags, never to alter what
// `vp run` receives. `--concurrency-limit N` and `--parallel` still work if passed, since vite-task
// gives a flag priority over the env var; in that case the note is suppressed, because it would
// announce a number the run is not using (concurrency.ts).
