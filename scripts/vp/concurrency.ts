// Picks the task concurrency for the `vp run` invocations this repo makes, from the machine it is
// running on.
//
// Vite+ runs at most `DEFAULT_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT = 4` tasks at once (vite-task,
// `crates/vt_plan/src/execution_graph.rs`) unless `--concurrency-limit N` or
// `VP_RUN_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT=N` says otherwise; it has no CPU or memory awareness of its own, and
// `defineConfig`'s `run` block has no setting for it, so a `vite.config.ts` cannot change it either.
// Almost nobody knows the env var exists, so on a 10-core / 32 GiB laptop `pnpm build` and
// `pnpm test` leave most of the machine idle. The flag and the env var are the only levers, which is
// why this is a wrapper around the repo's own invocations (root scripts via `run.ts`; the dev
// server, run-local and the release build set `env` on their spawns) rather than configuration. A
// bare `vp run -F <pkg> …` typed by hand still gets Vite+'s default. The dev server spawns two
// `vp run`s at once, so it divides the one limit between them (`concurrentRuns`, below) rather than
// handing each the whole machine.
//
// Formula: `max(4, min(availableParallelism(), floor(min(totalmem(), cgroup limit) / 2 GiB)))`.
//   - `availableParallelism()` rather than `cpus().length` because it respects cgroup CPU limits in
//     containers.
//   - ~2 GiB per task is the memory budget. Single-threaded `tsc` measures ~0.7 GB on the biggest
//     package (AGENTS.md), and the workerd test fleets are heavier -- they are the documented OOM /
//     hang risk -- so memory, not CPU, caps the count on small machines: 8 GiB → 4, 16 GiB → 8,
//     32 GiB → 10 on a 10-core laptop (CPU-bound), 64 GiB / 16 cores → 16. The budget is the
//     *smaller* of host RAM and whatever cgroup memory limit applies, because `totalmem()` reports
//     the host's physical memory and ignores the limit: in a container (`docker run -m 4g` on a
//     64 GiB host, a constrained CI runner) it would see 64 GiB and pick a concurrency the container
//     cannot sustain -- which is precisely the OOM this term exists to prevent. `totalmem()` alone
//     is the fallback wherever no limit is readable: macOS, Windows, no cgroupfs, unlimited cgroup.
//   - The floor is Vite+'s own default, so no machine gets slower than today. CI (`ubuntu-latest`,
//     4 vCPU / 16 GiB) lands on exactly 4, so CI behaviour is unchanged.
//
// The same limit sizes the vitest runs inside those tasks (`withVitestWorkerBudget`):
// `VITEST_MAX_WORKERS = min(cpus - 1, max(2, floor(cpus / tasks)))`, `tasks` being how many run at
// once. Left alone, every `vitest run` starts `cpus - 1` workers, so four suites on a 4-vCPU runner
// put ~12 forks plus workerd on 4 cores and starved the jsdom tests into timeouts. The floor of 2
// keeps the last suite of a run, which keeps the workers it started with, from running serially.
// An explicit `VITEST_MAX_WORKERS`, or a worker count among the forwarded arguments, wins.
//
// An explicit value always wins -- including a deliberately low one for an OOM-prone machine -- and
// is never validated or rewritten here: vite-task's own parser reports a bad value. Precedence is
// `--concurrency-limit` > `process.env.VP_RUN_CONCURRENCY_LIMIT` > the repo-root `.env` > this
// formula, and the note says which of the sources the number came from, since a value that silently
// failed to apply is the whole problem being avoided. That is also why a `--concurrency-limit` or
// `--parallel` on the command line prints nothing at all (`overridesConcurrency`): vite-task gives
// the flag priority over the variable, so a note naming our number would contradict the run.
//
// The `.env` step exists because that is where people reasonably expect to put a persistent
// per-machine setting, and neither half of the stack looks there on its own: nothing loads a root
// `.env` into `process.env` (no `--env-file`, no dotenv), and `vp` does not read one either, so the
// variable was silently ignored while this wrapper printed a note inviting the user to set the very
// variable they had just set. Note that a shell `export` in that file is inert unless the file is
// `source`d -- `parseEnv` tolerates the prefix, so the line works here either way.
//
// Only this one variable is read out of `.env`, deliberately: this is not a general environment
// bridge. A cached `vp` run strips the environment down to a built-in set and folds only declared
// vars into task fingerprints (see AGENTS.md), so forwarding arbitrary `.env` entries would change
// what tasks see without changing what they cache against.
